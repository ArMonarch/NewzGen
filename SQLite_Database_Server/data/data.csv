1,"article,features",,The web is disappearing. Can the Internet Archive save it?,Future,"Research shows 25% of web pages posted between 2013 and 2023 have vanished. A few organisations are racing to save the echoes of the web, but new risks threaten their very existence.
It's possible, thanks to surviving fragments of papyrus, mosaics and wax tablets, to learn what Pompeiians ate for breakfast 2,000 years ago. Understand enough Medieval Latin, and you can learn how many livestock were reared at farms in Northumberland in 11th Century England – thanks to the Domesday Book, the oldest document held in the UK National Archives. Through letters and novels, the social lives of the Victorian era – and who they loved and hated – come into view.
But historians of the future may struggle to understand fully how we lived our lives in the early 21st Century. That's because of a potentially history-deleting combination of how we live our lives digitally – and a paucity of official efforts to archive the world's information as it's produced these days.
However, an informal group of organisations are pushing back against the forces of digital entropy – many of them operated by volunteers with little institutional support. None is more synonymous with the fight to save the web than the Internet Archive, an American non-profit based in San Francisco, started in 1996 as a passion project by internet pioneer Brewster Kahl. The organisation has embarked what may be the most ambitious digital archiving project of all time, gathering 866 billion web pages, 44 million books, 10.6 million videos of films and television programmes and more. Housed in a handful of data centres scattered across the world, the collections of the Internet Archive and a few similar groups are the only things standing in the way of digital oblivion.
""The risks are manifold. Not just that technology may fail, but that certainly happens. But more important, that institutions fail, or companies go out of business. News organisations are gobbled up by other news organisations, or more and more frequently, they're shut down,"" says Mark Graham, director of the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine, a tool that collects and stores snapshots of websites for posterity. There are numerous incentives to put content online, he says, but there's little pushing companies to maintain it over the long term.
Despite the Internet Archive's achievements thus far, the organisation and others like it face financial threats, technical challenges, cyberattacks and legal battles from businesses who dislike the idea of freely available copies of their intellectual property. And as recent court losses show, the project of saving the internet could be just as fleeting as the content it's trying to protect.
""More and more of our intellectual endeavours, more of our entertainment, more of our news, and more of our conversations exist only in a digital environment,"" Graham says. ""That environment is inherently fragile.""
A quarter of all web pages that existed at some point between 2013 and 2023 now… don't. That's according to a recent study by Pew Research Center, a think tank based in Washington, DC, which raised the alarm of our disappearing digital history. Researchers found the problem is more acute the older a web page is: 38% of web pages that Pew tried to access that existed in 2013 no longer function. But it's also an issue for more recent publications. Some 8% of web pages published at some point 2023 were gone by October that same year.
This isn't just a concern for history buffs and internet obsessives. According to the study, one in five government websites contains at least one broken link. Pew found more than half of Wikipedia articles have a broken link in their references section, meaning the evidence backing up the online encyclopaedia's information is slowly disintegrating.
But thanks to the work of the Internet Archive, not all those dead links are totally inaccessible. For decades, the Archive's Wayback Machine project has sent armies of robots to crawl through the cascading labyrinths of the internet. These systems download functional copies of websites as they change over time – often capturing the same pages multiple times in a single day – and make them available to public free of charge.
""When we then went and looked at how many of those URLs were available in the Wayback Machine, we found that two-thirds of those were available in a way,"" he says. In that sense, the Internet Archive is doing what it set out to do – it's saving records of online society for posterity.
A few other organisations, big and small, work on similar projects. The US Library of Congress, for example, preserves government websites, the sites of congressmembers and a collection of US news sites. The Library of Congress also preserved a copy of  every single tweet sent since the founding of Twitter (now known as X), until the project was shut down in 2017. Other governments run their own initiatives. The UK Web Archive conducts an annual crawl of websites with .UK domain names, capturing a snapshot of the British internet at least once a year. In 2022, band of volunteers to set out to save the Ukrainian internet as it was hit by Russian cyberattacks.
But the scope of these projects is narrow, while the Internet Archive aims for a comprehensive approach. Given the available resources, it would be impossible to collect anything close to the whole internet, but its systems cast a broad net. Depending on what you're looking for, the Internet Archive's collection is so thorough it can sometimes feel like a functionally complete record of the web.
The Archive's publicly accessible documents help sustain records of our lives in the current era. It's become a standard practise on Wikipedia to cite copies of websites from the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine, rather than the original websites themselves. The organisation also preserves a vast collection of media that predates the digital era. The beloved 1977 comedy series Fernwood 2 Night isn't available on any streaming service, but you can watch it free on the Internet Archive. Books, magazines and websites cite the Internet Archive’s scanned digital copies of books that are unavailable in physical libraries. It even acts as a preservation tool for the public; anyone can upload videos, websites and practically anything else to organisation's servers.
Among the major collections that the Wayback Machine has salvaged from the digital scrapheap are deep records of websites built on GeoCities, a now defunct personal web hosting service. Long before social media, GeoCities was among the first platforms that made it easy for anyone to create their own website. Historians view GeoCities as one of the most important chapters in the early days of the world wide web, without the efforts of the Internet Archive, most of its websites would be lost. In more recent history, a US Congressional Committee relied on the Internet Archive to preserve article and documents related to the January 6 insurrection.
""Every few years there's a new platform come along and then the economic forces suddenly kind of collapse in it,"" says Andrew Jackson, preservation registry technical architect at the Digital Preservation Coalition, a UK-based advocacy group and charity that advises on how to preserve the world's online digital archives. ""That's one big source of churn.""
The tech news website CNET faced backlash in 2023 after reports that the company had deleted tens of thousands of articles, amounting to decades of lost history. Among CNET's responses was a promise that all its deleted articles had been preserved in the Wayback Machine. Many critics argued the company was taking the Internet Archive for granted, passing on its own archival responsibilities.
""Even though Google and other search engines actively incentivise you to maintain stable URLs, it's just technically quite difficult to do that,"" says Jackson. ""Every time a new company kind of revamped its website, it has to work out how much of its new URLs it's going to try and maintain through time.""
But it's worth remembering what the Internet Archive is: a non-profit organisation, financed by donations from charitable foundations. It makes for a never-ending project with exponentially growing costs. The Internet Archive volunteered to take on the mantle of being the world's leading library for our digital lives. As the web approaches its fourth decade, this entirely unofficial project has become a foundational pillar of the internet.
But as our reliance on the Internet Archive grows, so too do the threats pecking away at its efforts.
Last week, the organisation announced a major partnership with Google, where the tech giant engine will include links to the Wayback Machine in search results – though neither released financial details about the deal.
But other recent news demonstrates that the project is still fragile. That vulnerability was laid bare in a court case against the Internet Archive by four large book publishers, who alleged that the Internet Archive’s practise of scanning physical books and lending out digital copies breaches US copyright law. Before the pandemic, the Internet Archive would only lend one digital copy at a time for each physical book in its collection. But during the Covid shutdowns, the organisation lifted that restriction, letting patrons borrow unlimited digital copies of books to try and make up for the closure of physical libraries.
A US court ruled that practice was illegal in 2023, and in early September, the Internet Archive’s appeal against that decision was rejected. The organisation previously said that it agreed to pay the a publishing industry trade group an undisclosed sum in relation to the case.
With that lawsuit in the rearview, the Internet Archive is fighting yet another court case against music labels for digitising records that could cost it $400m (about £305m) if it loses. It's an amount that could jeopardise the non-profit's survival.
Internet Archive's director of library services Chris Freeland said the organisation is reviewing the courts' opinion a statement about the ruling. 
Existential legal battles aren't the only hazards menacing the world of digital preservation. The British Library's UK Web Archive got a taste of some malevolent technical challenges last when a cyberattack took its digital systems offline in October 2023. Almost a year later, the UK Web Archive is still dealing with the fallout. Online access to much of its collection is still unavailable.
In May 2024, the Internet Archive announced it was in the midst of a large distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack. In a DDoS attack, vandals or other bad actors set up automated systems to bombard websites with visits, attempting to push them offline by overwhelming their servers. At its peak, tens of thousands of concurrent visits were happening every second. Services, including the Wayback Machine, went down. It meant that the regular drumbeat of archiving was disrupted for a time, and there may be permanent gaps in the historical record as a result.
The Internet Archive ""was started by one individual, and it has become a kind of linchpin"", says Jackson. ""It also feels like this potential single point of failure. Although it's a lot more sophisticated than just volunteers, it is one institution in one region, under one legal framework.""
The organisation shares these concerns. If the Internet Archive's work stopped and ""that void wasn't immediately filled, then much of what is currently made available on the public web would be at risk"", says Graham.
He's clear that the Internet Archive won't step back from its responsibilities anytime soon, but the project can use outside help. ""There are opportunities for many others to contribute in a variety of ways,"" he says.
With no formal effort to organise efforts to preserve the internet, the project is left to hobbyists, volunteers, and a few groups of unofficial bodies that generally operate independently.
""It makes sense that the archival response is decentralised,"" says Mar Hicks, a historian of technology at the University of Virginia. ""But one of the problems is the varied priorities.""
Hicks points out that one of the first things any archivist will consider when building an archive is what to prioritise. ""And when it's so decentralised, the priorities are going to be very different,"" Hicks says. ""There's going to be people in groups who prioritise trying to grab everything – as much as they possibly can, they might be very completionist."" Then there will be others who are focused only on certain areas – for instance, the UK archiving effort.
The concern about such an ad hoc, decentralised approach is that it's possible there's overlap, meaning precious archiving resources are wasted getting duplicate or triplicate copies of the most popular websites – all while some areas that may have historical importance are overlooked because they fall between different groups' responsibilities.
""Archivists will tell you that these issues have existed for a very long time,"" Hicks says. But they're exacerbated by the level of stuff being produced in our digital world. Nearly a billion emails are sent every day. YouTube reports that more than 500 hours' worth of video content is posted on the platform every minute.
The internet is ""essentially a firehose of information and material,"" says Hicks. ""It doesn't make sense to try to catch everything that comes out of the firehose. That wouldn't make sense from a resource standpoint.""
In one sense this is an old concern. ""We have, as historians, those same problems,"" says Hicks. ""We have a wealth of documents from the past. But we only have certain documents and certain people's voices, and a lot of those voices that were missing were incredibly important, and they've been erased.""
For Hicks, there needs to be some sort of priority about what is being saved from the digital footprints of our generation. Otherwise we run the risk that rapidly ballooning costs will sideline efforts to save the history of the web – not to mention the oceans of digital files that live offline.
""If you have to keep everything, it becomes very expensive,"" says Jackson of the Digital Preservation Coalition. ""There's often older content or less compelling content [that] gets lost by the wayside,"" he says.
""We're not capturing the non-Western world well,"" admits Jackson. ""There are gaps now around incompleteness in different cultural domains.""
And while many of those organisations work to fight against their biases and prejudices, they're often left to carry the weight of the task while governments and the companies that run the platforms and websites sit by. ""Independent groups of people, who are just caring about it and are willing to spend their free time doing it, are better resourced and more highly skilled than the institutions which are formally responsible,"" says Jackson.
More like this:• Why there’s so little left of the early internet• How will future archaeologists study us?• Google just updated its algorithm. The Internet will never be the same
There's a vacuum, argues Hicks, which few people other than a handful of archivist obsessives are filling. ""It's not clear whose responsibility it is to archive [the internet] or whose interest it would serve,"" Hicks says.
One thing is clear, though, Hicks says, we should all pay up to support the fight for preservation. ""From a very pragmatic perspective, if you do not pay these people and make sure that these archives are funded, they will not exist into the future, they will break down and then the whole point of collecting them will have gone out the window,"" says Hicks. ""Because the whole point of the archive is not that it just gets collected, but that it persists indefinitely into the future.""
The Enlightenment of the 18th century saw the birth of an international library movement as governments and philanthropists took on the need to preserve and distribute books for the public. But that sense of civic responsibility hasn't extended to the internet. That may be due to the complicated business interests of the digital world, or just the immense technical challenge. Or, perhaps, it's because it doesn't feel like the web needs saving to casual observers. A book is a more obviously finite resource; it can be lost or damaged. But the internet feels so accessible. Anyone with an internet connection can pull up a web browser and dial in a URL. It's all right there – until it isn't.

2,"article,news",,NatWest blocks staff from using WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger,Technology,"NatWest Group has blocked messaging services WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger and Skype on company devices in the UK to stop staff using them to communicate with each other.The bank had already told employees to stick to ""approved channels"" for conversations about business matters.But now it has gone further and made the platforms inaccessible on work phones and computers.So-called off-channel communications are a persistent problem in both business and politics, with concerns that services such as WhatsApp are used to reduce the scrutiny some conversations can be subject to.Messages can be difficult to retrieve or even set to disappear - whereas those sent via approved channels are fully retrievable, meaning they can be looked into if there is any suspected wrongdoing.""Like many organisations, we only permit the use of approved channels for communicating about business matters, whether internally or externally,"" NatWest said in a statement.It said the change came into effect earlier this month.
Banks in the US have been handed fines worth more than $2.8bn (£2.18bn) over the past few years over record-keeping rules - with workers unable to retrieve old messages from some messaging services.JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, Bank of America and Citigroup are among those to be issued with penalties.It was reported in August that the UK banking regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), is considering a probe into how bank workers use messaging services.It follows a fine issued by energy regulator Ofgem to Morgan Stanley over calls made on private phones over WhatsApp - breaching rules on record-keeping.Outside of banking, there have been issues with staff using apps in the public sector, with questions surrounding how ministers have used WhatsApp for government business in recent years.The UK Covid inquiry revealed officials and ministers had deleted WhatsApp messages exchanged during the pandemic.That included then-prime minister Boris Johnson, with then cabinet member Penny Mordaunt telling the inquiry that two years of messages with him had disappeared. Johnson told the inquiry he had lost around 5,000 messages.

3,"article,news",,Seven wild moments from the turbulent story of Bitcoin,Technology,"Donald Trump's victory in the US presidential election has helped push the price of Bitcoin to a series of record highs.Backers of the digital currency are celebrating, and wondering how much more valuable it could become - with some suggesting it could reach $100,000 per coin.Its price is rocketing because the president-elect has vowed to make the US ""the crypto capital of the planet"" - a remarkable turnaround given as recently as 2021 he was calling Bitcoin a ""scam.""He even started accepting Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as donations to his election campaign and raised millions from the industry.But that is just one of the many twists and turns in the jaw-dropping story of Bitcoin, which continues to captivate people worldwide and has seen the making - and losing - of huge fortunes.Here's the BBC's list of the seven wildest moments - so far - in Bitcoin's tumultuous history.
1. The mysterious creator of BitcoinDespite its enormous profile, no-one actually knows for sure who invented Bitcoin. The idea for it was posted on internet forums in 2008 by someone calling themselves Satoshi Nakamoto.They explained how a peer-to-peer digital cash system could work to enable people to send virtual coins over the internet, just as easily as sending an email.Satoshi created a complex computer system that would process transactions and create new coins using a huge network of self-appointed volunteers around the world who used special software and powerful computers.But he - or they - never revealed their identity, and the world has never worked it out.
In 2014, Japanese-American man Dorian Nakamoto was pursued by reporters who thought he was the elusive Bitcoin creator, but it proved to be false lead caused by some mistranslated information.Australian computer scientist Craig Wright said it was him in 2016 - but after years of legal battles, a High Court judge concluded he was not Satoshi.Earlier this year, a Canadian Bitcoin expert called Peter Todd strongly denied being Satoshi, while in London this month a British man, Stephen Mollah, claimed he was - but no-one believed him.
2. Making history with pizzaBitcoin now underpins a two trillion-dollar cryptocurrency industry - but the first recorded transaction using it was the purchase of pizza.On 22 May 2010, Lazlo Hanyecz, offered $41 worth of Bitcoin on a crypto forum in return for two pizzas.A 19-year-old student obliged and the day went down in history for fans of the currency as #BitcoinPizza day.A source of memes for those in crypto community, it also showcased the power of Bitcoin - an internet money that could genuinely buy items online.Criminals must have been watching too, because within a year the first darknet marketplace was launched selling drugs and other illegal goods in exchange for Bitcoin.The deal looks pretty bad for Lazlo now too. If he had held onto those coins they would now be worth hundreds of millions of dollars!3. Becoming legal tenderIn September 2021, President Nayib Bukele of El Salvador, central America, made Bitcoin legal tender.Hairdressers, supermarkets and other shops had to accept Bitcoin by law, alongside its main currency, the US dollar.Many Bitcoin enthusiasts and reporters visited the area, briefly boosting tourism to the country.While President Bukele hoped the move would increase investment in his country and cut costs for citizens exchanging money, it did not become as popular as he hoped.He is still hoping it will take off but for now the US dollar still remains king in the country.
As well as the huge amount of public money President Bukele spent on trying to make people embrace Bitcoin he also, controversially, bought more than 6,000 bitcoins over the past few years. The president spent at least $120m buying up bitcoins at various prices in the hope of making a profit for his cash-strapped country.It started to look good for him in December 2023 when, for the first time, his stash skyrocketed in value. A website built by Dutch software engineer Elias Zerrouq is tracking the country's Bitcoin holdings and currently estimates that the coins have risen 98% in value.4. Kazakhstan's crypto boom and bustIn 2021, Kazakhstan became a hotspot for Bitcoin mining - the process of crunching through the complex calculations that underpin crypto transactions.These days it takes warehouses full of the latest computers running all day and all night, but the reward is brand new bitcoins for those companies that take part.
Warehouses of computers require lots of power - and many businesses moved to Kazakhstan where electricity was abundant thanks to huge coal reserves.At first the government welcomed them with open arms as they brought investment.But too many miners arrived and put huge strain on the electricity grid, putting the country at risk of blackouts.Within a year, Kazakhstan's Bitcoin mining industry went from boom to bust as the government imposed restrictions and increased taxes to curb the growth.Around the world it is estimated that the Bitcoin network uses as much electricity as a small country, raising concerns about its environmental impact.5. Bitcoins in the rubbish dumpImagine having a crypto wallet worth more than $100m (£78m) - and then  accidentally throwing away a hard drive containing the login details.That's what James Howells, from south Wales, says happened to himThe very nature of crypto means that recovery is not as easy as resetting your password. With no banks involved - there is no customer support helpline.
Unfortunately for him, his local council in Newport refused to let him access the landfill site where he says the device ended up - even after he offered to donate 25% of his Bitcoin stash to local charities if they let him.He told the BBC: ""It was a penny dropping moment and it was a sinking feeling.""6. Crypto King fraudsterNo one has lost as much Bitcoin as former billionaire crypto mogul, Sam Bankman-Fried. The founder of the massive crypto firm FTX was nicknamed the Crypto King and loved by the community.FTX was a cryptocurrency exchange that allowed people to trade normal money for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.
His empire was worth an estimated $32bn and he was flying high until everything came crashing down within days.Journalists had discovered that Bankman-Fried's company was financially shaky and had been illegally transferring FTX customer funds to prop up his other company, Alameda Research.Just before his arrest at his luxury apartment complex in the Bahamas in December 2022 he spoke to reporters. He told the BBC: ""I don't think I committed fraud. I didn't want any of this to happen. I was certainly not nearly as competent as I thought I was.""After being extradited to the US he was found guilty of fraud and money laundering and was jailed for 25 years.7. Investment bank boomDespite all the turmoil, Bitcoin continues to attract attention from investors and big companies.In fact, in January 2024, some of the biggest financial firms in the world added Bitcoin to their official asset lists as Spot Bitcoin ETFs. These are like stocks and shares, linked to the value of Bitcoin but you don't have to personally own any.Customers have been pouring billions into these brand new products. Companies including Blackrock, Fidelity and GrayScale, have also been buying up Bitcoins in their thousands, pushing up its value to record highs.It is a huge milestone for crypto with some fans believing that Bitcoin is finally being taken as seriously as the mysterious Satoshi imagined.Nonetheless, few would back against more wild moments as the Bitcoin story continues to unfold.

4,"article,news",,'I was moderating hundreds of horrific and traumatising videos',Technology,"Over the past few months the BBC has been exploring a dark, hidden world – a world where the very worst, most horrifying, distressing, and in many cases, illegal online content ends up.Beheadings, mass killings, child abuse, hate speech – all of it ends up in the inboxes of a global army of content moderators.You don’t often see or hear from them – but these are the people whose job it is to review and then, when necessary, delete content that either gets reported by other users, or is automatically flagged by tech tools.The issue of online safety has become increasingly prominent, with tech firms under more pressure to swiftly remove harmful material.And despite a lot of research and investment pouring into tech solutions to help, ultimately for now, it’s still largely human moderators who have the final say.Moderators are often employed by third-party companies, but they work on content posted directly on to the big social networks including Instagram, TikTok and Facebook.
They are based around the world. The people I spoke to while making our series The Moderators for Radio 4 and BBC Sounds, were largely living in East Africa, and all had since left the industry.Their stories were harrowing. Some of what we recorded was too brutal to broadcast. Sometimes my producer Tom Woolfenden and I would finish a recording and just sit in silence.“If you take your phone and then go to TikTok, you will see a lot of activities, dancing, you know, happy things,” says Mojez, a former Nairobi-based moderator who worked on TikTok content. “But in the background, I personally was moderating, in the hundreds, horrific and traumatising videos.“I took it upon myself. Let my mental health take the punch so that general users can continue going about their activities on the platform.”There are currently multiple ongoing legal claims that the work has destroyed the mental health of such moderators. Some of the former workers in East Africa have come together to form a union.“Really, the only thing that’s between me logging onto a social media platform and watching a beheading, is somebody sitting in an office somewhere, and watching that content for me, and reviewing it so I don’t have to,” says Martha Dark who runs Foxglove, a campaign group supporting the legal action.
In 2020, Meta then known as Facebook, agreed to pay a settlement of $52m (£40m) to moderators who had developed mental health issues because of their jobs.The legal action was initiated by a former moderator in the US called Selena Scola. She described moderators as the “keepers of souls”, because of the amount of footage they see containing the final moments of people’s lives.The ex-moderators I spoke to all used the word “trauma” in describing the impact the work had on them. Some had difficulty sleeping and eating.One described how hearing a baby cry had made a colleague panic. Another said he found it difficult to interact with his wife and children because of the child abuse he had witnessed.Information and support can be found via BBC Action Line
I was expecting them to say that this work was so emotionally and mentally gruelling, that no human should have to do it – I thought they would fully support the entire industry becoming automated, with AI tools evolving to scale up to the job.But they didn’t.What came across, very powerfully, was the immense pride the moderators had in the roles they had played in protecting the world from online harm.They saw themselves as a vital emergency service. One says he wanted a uniform and a badge, comparing himself to a paramedic or firefighter.“Not even one second was wasted,” says someone who we called David. He asked to remain anonymous, but he had worked on material that was used to train the viral AI chatbot ChatGPT, so that it was programmed not to regurgitate horrific material.“I am proud of the individuals who trained this model to be what it is today.”
But the very tool David had helped to train, might one day compete with him.Dave Willner is former head of trust and safety at OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT. He says his team built a rudimentary moderation tool, based on the chatbot’s tech, which managed to identify harmful content with an accuracy rate of around 90%.“When I sort of fully realised, ‘oh, this is gonna work’, I honestly choked up a little bit,” he says. “[AI tools] don't get bored. And they don't get tired and they don't get shocked…. they are indefatigable.”Not everyone, however, is confident that AI is a silver bullet for the troubled moderation sector.“I think it’s problematic,” says Dr Paul Reilly, senior lecturer in media and democracy at the University of Glasgow. “Clearly AI can be a quite blunt, binary way of moderating content.“It can lead to over-blocking freedom of speech issues, and of course it may miss nuance human moderators would be able to identify. Human moderation is essential to platforms,” he adds.“The problem is there’s not enough of them, and the job is incredibly harmful to those who do it.”
We also approached the tech companies mentioned in the series.A TikTok spokesperson says the firm knows content moderation is not an easy task, and it strives to promote a caring working environment for employees. This includes offering clinical support, and creating programs that support moderators' wellbeing.They add that videos are initially reviewed by automated tech, which they say removes a large volume of harmful content.Meanwhile, Open AI - the company behind Chat GPT - says it's grateful for the important and sometimes challenging work that human workers do to train the AI to spot such photos and videos. A spokesperson adds that, with its partners, Open AI enforces policies to protect the wellbeing of these teams.And Meta - which owns Instagram and Facebook - says it requires all companies it works with to provide 24-hour on-site support with trained professionals. It adds that moderators are able to customise their reviewing tools to blur graphic content.The Moderators is on BBC Radio 4 at 13:45 GMT, Monday 11, November to Friday 15, November, and on BBC Sounds.

5,"article,news",,DNA firm holding highly sensitive data 'vanishes' without warning,Technology,"A DNA-testing firm appears to have ceased trading - without telling its customers what has happened to the highly sensitive data they shared with it.Atlas Biomed, which has offices in London, offered to provide insights into people's genetic make up as well as their predisposition to certain illnesses.However, users are no longer able to access their personalised reports online and the company has not responded to the BBC's requests for comment.Customers of the firm describe the situation as ""very alarming"" and say they want answers about what has happened to their ""most personal information"".The regulator, the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), has confirmed it has received a complaint about Atlas Biomed.""People have the right to expect that organisations will handle their personal information securely and responsibly,"" it said in a statement.Experts say it shows how users of DNA-testing services can find themselves ""completely at the mercy"" of such companies when it comes to protecting very sensitive data.
Lisa Topping, from Saffron Walden, Essex, sent a saliva sample to Atlas Biomed several years ago, paying around £100 for a personalised genetic report.As well as telling her about her DNA profile, it claimed to also inform her about her predisposition to diseases and even injuries, taking into account information she had provided in an accompanying questionnaire. She could access her report online - which she checked from time to time  – until one day the website disappeared. She got no reply when she contacted them to ask what had happened.""I don’t know what someone else could do with [the data] but it’s the most personal information… I don’t know how comfortable I feel that they have just disappeared,"" Lisa told me.In 2023, Kate Lake from Tonbridge, Kent, paid Atlas Biomed £139 for a report it never delivered. It promised her a refund - then went silent, despite her trying every means of contact she could find.""I just never heard back from anyone, it’s like no-one was at home,"" she said.She describes the situation as ""very alarming."" ""What happens now to that information they have got? I would like to hear some answers,"" she said.The BBC was also unable to contact Atlas Biomed.A phone number listed for the company is dead. The BBC visited its offices in London, but there was no sign of Atlas Biomed there.The firm’s Instagram account, with over 11,000 followers, was last updated in March 2022. Its final post on X was in August the same year. It shared a post on Facebook in June 2023, but did not respond to any of the comments – which were full of people complaining about being unable to contact it or access their profiles. 
The apparent disappearance of Atlas Biomed is a mystery - but it appears to have links with Russia.It is still listed as an active company with Companies House, where all UK-based businesses must register. However, it has not filed any accounts since December 2022.It lists eight official positions - though four of its officers have resigned. Two of the apparently remaining officers are listed at the same address in Moscow - as is a Russian billionaire, who is described as a now resigned director.Atlas Biomed's registered office is near London's so-called Silicon Roundabout, one of the prime locations in the UK for tech firms.When the BBC visited, there was no sign of Atlas Biomed itself, but a company registration firm based in the building confirmed that it was a client of theirs, and legitimately used the address as its own.
This firm, in an email, claimed that it could not put the BBC in touch with Atlas Biomed ""for security purposes"".""We highly suggest that you contact them directly,"" it said.No-one from Atlas Biomed has responded to the BBC's attempts to contact it.Cybersecurity expert Prof Alan Woodward said the apparent links to Russia were ""odd.""""If people knew the provenance of this company and how it operates they might not be quite so ready to trust them with their DNA,"" he told the BBC.
None of this explains where Atlas Biomed’s database of customer DNA has ended up - and the BBC has seen no evidence it is being misused.But Prof Carissa Veliz - author of Privacy is Power - points out that DNA is arguably the most valuable personal data you have.  It is uniquely yours, you can’t change it, and it reveals your – and by extension, your family’s - biological strengths and weaknesses. Biometric data is given special protection under the UK’s version of GDPR, the data protection law.""When you give your data to a company you are completely at their mercy and you have to be able to trust them,"" Prof Veliz said.""We shouldn’t have to wait until something happens.""Additional reporting by Graham Fraser

6,"article,news",,Roblox announces new safety features for under-13s,Technology,"Roblox is introducing new safety features for children under the age of 13, following criticism of how it protects younger users.The free online gaming platform, which has around 70 million daily users worldwide, allows players to create their own games and play those made by others.It is particularly popular with children - but some have complained they have been exposed to upsetting and harmful content on the site.Starting 3 December, game creators will be asked to say whether their games are suitable for under-13s - with any that fail to do so being blocked for players 12 and younger.And from 18 November, under-13s will also be barred from accessing ""social hangouts"", which are online spaces where players can talk to each other by text and voice.It specifies hangout experiences as games where ""the primary theme or purpose"" is to allow people to communicate with each other as themselves, rather than role-playing as a character.Younger users will also be unable to use ""free-form 2D user creation"" from the same date, which it said were games ""that allow users to draw or write in 2D and replicate those creations to other users without the completed creation going through Roblox moderation"".It is thought that this is aimed at preventing users writing or drawing offensive images or messages which are difficult to moderate.""We recognize the deadline is soon, but we greatly appreciate your cooperation in helping us ensure Roblox is a safe and civil place for users of all ages to come together,"" it said in a post on the Roblox developer website.
According to the media regulator Ofcom, Roblox is the most popular game in the UK for children aged 8 to 12.But it has faced criticism over its protections for younger users, with one young person telling the BBC in May he had been approached on Roblox and asked for sexual images.At the time, Ofcom, the regulator for online safety, told tech firms to hide ""toxic"" content from children and published draft codes of practice.Since then there have been further issues, with Turkey entirely blocking access to Roblox in August.“As a company that’s transparent with our community of developers, we needed to share key information about the upcoming changes prior to launch,"" Roblox told the BBC in a statement.“We’re constantly strengthening our safety systems and policies — we shipped over 30 improvements this year and we have more to come,” it added.But despite announcing the changes would begin swiftly, it said it would not begin enforcing the requirements until 2025.

7,"article,news",,Moldova cleans up its act to attract foreign businesses,Europe,"The Eastern European country of Moldova is continuing efforts to attract overseas firms, as it tries to move past political uncertainty.""I went with a backpack, and set up a business,"" says Dutch entrepreneur Luc Vocks, recalling how he moved to Moldova in 2007.Mr Vocks had first visited the former Soviet republic three years earlier, and recalls experiencing ""the cliché that one would have of Eastern Europe at that time"". ""Everything was dirt cheap, and if you were a foreigner you'd get attention,"" he says.Today, Mr Vocks is the owner of a Moldovan company called DevelopmentAid. Based in the capital Chisinau, it employs 180 people in the country, and runs a website that lists job vacancies in the international development community.Mr Vocks is one of a growing number of foreign entrepreneurs in Moldova. The government wants to attract more like him and hopes that low business tax rates will help.The country's standard corporation tax rate - the amount that firms have to pay on their profits - is just 12%. This compares with 25% in the UK, and 25.8% in the Netherlands where Mr Vocks had initially launched his company before relocating it to Moldova.There's an even better deal for tech firms. In 2018 the Moldovan government launched an initiative to grow the country's IT sector - the Moldova IT Park (MITP).This isn't a physical business park. Instead it is virtual scheme open to all IT firms in the country - and those that wish to move there from overseas. Firms that sign up only have to pay a corporation tax rate of 7%.The MITP is part of a wider effort by the Moldovan government to modernise and expand its economy ahead of a bid to join the European Union in 2030.This drive is being led by Moldova's pro-EU President Maia Sandu, who this week was re-elected for a second term. And last month Moldovans voted ""yes"" on pro-EU constitutional changes.However, the vote was extremely close, with Yes getting 50.46% and No receiving 49.54%. Although Russia denied interfering in the vote, Moldova’s authorities said attempts had been made to buy up to 300,000 votes in what Maia Sandu described as an ""unprecedented assault on freedom and democracy"".Moscow is opposed to Moldova joining the EU, and supports Moldova's breakaway region of Transnistria economically, politically and militarily.
Dumitru Alaiba, Moldova's deputy prime minister and minister for economic development and digitalisation, is positive about where Moldova is heading.""Moldova in the past 10 to 15 years has really proven that it's a country that can change very fast,"" he tells the BBC. ""This used to be a highly corrupt country, a country where, exactly 10 years ago, a billion dollars from our central banks just disappeared.""""We are moving very fast towards joining the EU, and we are reforming our economy at top speed. Of course, we have a long way to go.""He pointed to Moldova's rise on the global Corruption Perceptions Index, produced by anti-corruption watchdog Transparency International. Out of 180 countries - with a lower placing meaning that a country is less corrupt - Moldova is now in 76th place, up from 91st a year earlier.""Now entrepreneurs can breathe freely without fear of repercussion, without fear of corrupt inspectors, without fear of a filthy justice sector that commits crazy abuses.""Mr Vocks agrees that Moldova is now a much easier place in which to do business than when he first set up his company there back in 2007.""Back then, it was extremely bureaucratic. It was hard to get a residence permit. It was painful to register a company, especially as a foreigner.""It was painful intersecting with the tax agency. The banks were rough to work with.""
Member companies of the MITP don't just benefit from the 7% corporation tax rate. They also don't need to make employer social security contributions, and staff don't have to pay income tax. Mr Volks signed up DevelopmentAid almost immediately.The MITP has also simplified immigration procedures through the IT Visa program.More than 2,000 companies are now registered with the MITP, 300 of which have come from overseas. The most common countries these have moved from being the US, UK, Germany, Netherlands, and Ukraine.In the first half of 2024, MITP firms generated a combined €365m ($397m; £308m) in revenues, according to official figures. And now employing 22,000 people in general, they are said to contribute around 6% of the country's GDP.While the MITP scheme has worked to boost Moldova's IT sector, the influx of foreign tech companies has driven up salaries in the industry considerably.Sven Wiese, a German expat who has set up a small IT services business in the country called Trabia, says he is now finding himself priced out when it comes to employee pay.He says that the biggest firms signed up to the MITP can offer IT specialists more than €100,000 a year, ""because that is still cheaper than hiring people within a bigger country like the US or Germany"".
At the same time he says that many Moldovan IT sector workers still want to leave the country. ""Fewer people are now leaving Moldova, but emigration is still high.""Another negative issue is the continuing war in neighbouring Ukraine, which is likely making some Western IT firms think twice about investing in Moldova. Mr Alaiba says is confident that Moldova is safe ""as long as the free world is supporting Ukraine"".Marina Bzovii, MITP's administrator and an assistant professor at the Technical University of Moldova, already sees Moldova as a regional business hub. ""Moldova is connecting even Central Asia, countries like Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, who are culturally much further from Europe.""However, Moldova understands both of the cultures. So it's the kind of business hub that Europe needs... and Chisinau is now really vibrant.""

8,"article,news",,"Vodafone-Three merger could get green light, watchdog says ",Technology,"The regulator says a merger between Vodafone and Three could go ahead - if both companies make price promises for consumers and commit to boosting the UK's 5G rollout.The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) had previously said that creating what would be the country's biggest mobile network could drive up prices and harm competition.But it has now provisionally concluded those concerns could be addressed - and the merger could proceed - if the firms agree to its proposed remedies. A Vodafone spokesperson said both companies would need to study the CMA's proposal more closely but believed on first impressions it ""provides a path to final clearance"".They insisted, as they have throughout, that the deal was in everyone's interests.""It will bring significant benefits to businesses and consumers throughout the UK, and it will bring advanced 5G to every school and hospital across the country,"" they said.The CMA's findings are the latest step in its probe into the merger, which began in January.Vodafone and Three announced their plans to merge their UK-based operations in June last year.Their combined network would have around 27 million customers.""We believe this deal has the potential to be pro-competitive for the UK mobile sector if our concerns are addressed,"" said Stuart McIntosh, who is leading the CMA panel investigating the merger.""We anticipate in the longer term that the significant commitment to upgrade the merged companies network over the next 10 years or so will ultimately create a competitive environment that will maintain the competition we've seen in mobile in recent years,"" he told the Today programme, on BBC Radio Four.But he also made clear that short term commitments not to increase the price of certain existing mobile tariffs and data plans for at least three years were also key to making sure consumers did not lose out.The regulator also said upholding pre-agreed deals or prices with Mobile Virtual Network Operators such as Sky Mobile, Lyca and Lebara could protect consumers and and wholesale customers alike.Industry analyst Paolo Pescatore told the BBC it marked ""another key step towards approval"" and showed all concerned were trying to find a way to make the deal happen.The two largest players in the market are currently EE and 02 - Mr Pescatore said a merged Vodafone and Three would be in a better place to take them on.""To date, both parties are demonstrating that this is genuinely in the interest of UK plc, the economy, and users which paves the way for a far stronger three-player market than the current imbalance,"" he said.The CMA is seeking responses to its proposed remedies by 12 November, with a deadline of 7 December for a final decision on the merger.

9,"article,features",,How images alter the way you think,Future,"The images we are exposed to on social media and internet websites have a surprising influence on the way we view the world.
Every day we are bombarded with digital images. They appear on our social media feeds, in our search results and the websites we browse. People send them to us via messaging apps or over email. By the end of today, billions more will have been uploaded and shared online.
With the average user spending 6 hours and 40 minutes per day on the internet, according to one report, these images make up a significant portion of our everyday visual input.
And, recent research indicates that they may even be influencing our perceptions.
One study published earlier this year analysed images on Google,Wikipedia and the Internet Movie Database (IMBD), specifically looking at what genders predominated when they searched for different occupations – such as ""farmer"", ""chief executive officer"" or ""TV reporter"". The findings were stark. Although women were underrepresented overall, gender stereotypes were strong. Categories like ""plumber"", ""developer"", ""investment banker"" and ""heart surgeon"" were far more likely to be male. ""Housekeeper"", ""nurse practitioner"", ""cheerleader"" and ""ballet dancer"" tended to be female.
So far, so unsurprising. Anecdotally, I found the same phenomenon myself in 2019, when I was trying to find gender-balanced images for this website. Searching on Getty Creative, one of our main stock photo sites, I had found that photographs of male doctors outstripped female doctors by three to one – even though in the US, for example, physicians under 44 at the time were more likely to be female than male. This depiction of medical professionals were only part of the problem. There were twice as many options for photos of women with babies, or for that matter, of women with salads, as of men.
The latest study, however, took this a step further. Rather than just showing the extent of gender bias in online imagery, the researchers tested whether exposure to these images had any impact on people's own biases. In the experiment, 423 US participants used Google to search for different occupations. Two groups searched by text, using either Google or Google News; another group used Google Images, instead. (A control group also used Google, but to search for categories unrelated to occupations, like ""apple"" and ""guitar""). Then all participants were given an ""implicit association test"", which measures implicit biases.
Compared to Googling text-based descriptions of occupations, the participants who used Google Images and received visual representations in response showed much higher rates of implicit gender bias after the experiment – both immediately after and three days later.
""The rise of images in popular internet culture may come at a critical social cost,"" the researchers write. ""Our findings are especially alarming given that image-based social media platforms such as Instagram, Snapchat and TikTok are surging in popularity, accelerating the mass production and circulation of images. In parallel, popular search engines such as Google are increasingly incorporating images into their core functionality, for example, by including images as a default part of text-based searches.""
There's another growing problem, too: how the images already circulating online are informing and shaping AI models. Earlier this year, I experimented with this myself. I asked ChatGPT to create images for me of dozens of various professionals: doctor, lawyer, scientist, comedian, poet, teacher, customer service representative, nutritionist, thought leader, CEO, expert. Except for two or three results – dental hygienist, nurse and housekeeper – it delivered, again and again, a man. And not just a man, but a slim white man around his 30s with a crop of flowing brown hair.
In a later attempt, trying to get away from career bias, I asked ChatGPT to come up with different sorts of people for me: someone ""smart"", someone ""successful"", someone watching an opera, someone watching the show Love Is Blind, someone who quit their job to take care of the kids. Once again, over and over, I got the white guy with the lustrous hair.
Obviously, models like ChatGPT are learning based on the imagery that already exists. But, once again, this may perpetuate a vicious cycle: the more biased images AI models themselves spit out, the more we see; the more we see, the more implicitly biased we become ourselves. And the more biased we become, the more we create and upload our own biased imagery. (Find out more about how gender biases shape our brains.)
So what can be done? A good deal of responsibility lies with the tech and AI companies. But even when their intentions are good, there doesn't seem to be an easy fix. In its attempt to correct for racial, gender and other biases, for example, Google's AI tool Gemini sometimes overcorrected – one image it generated of the US Founding Fathers included a black man, for example, while an image of German soldiers from World War Two featured a black man and an Asian woman.
In the meantime, we need to take control of shaping our digital visual world ourselves.
While it seems obvious, the fact that we can – to a certain extent – curate our social media feeds often goes overlooked. Seeking out accounts and influencers who are of different ethnic and racial backgrounds, or photographers from different parts of the world, is one easy, actionable tip. We can also influence the search results we get by altering the way we phrase the initial query.
The most effective strategy of all might be reclaiming our time. In the eponymous ""digital detox plan"" of art entrepreneur Marine Tanguy's book The Visual Detox: How to Consume Media Without Letting It Consume You, for example, there are no surprises, but some good, solid reminders – such as putting limits on when you look at a screen or your phone, deleting apps you aren't using, and spending time outside without technology.
I became aware recently that even my several-year-old phone has a timer you can switch on for various apps, choosing whatever time period per day you'd like. While I can't say that I've always heeded its warning when I hit my limit, it's helped me become much more aware of, and cut down on, my social media usage. As we have covered before, putting your phone in another room entirely seems to keep even the thought of checking it at bay. 
Above all else, however, it may be awareness that is key. We don't often think about our visual consumption or consider how often we're surrounded by images that have been deliberately created and served to us, often to persuade us to purchase something.
Nor do we think about just how strange and new a phenomenon that is. For the vast majority of human evolutionary history – some 99% of the time we have been around – we wouldn't have seen many images within our own natural environment at all, save some cave paintings or handmade sculptures. While, in Europe, the Renaissance ushered in a new era of image production – which saw the rise of art markets and of artworks made for popular consumption, like printmaking – people still wouldn't have seen anywhere near the number of man-made images that we see today.
In the more than 100,000 generations since the Homo branch of the evolutionary tree emerged, we have evolved to spend far more time looking at the world (and people) around us than at images, never mind images on a screen. Perhaps, it seems, there is an argument for trying to incorporate more of that time away from our screens into our everyday lives today.

10,"article,news",,Whirlwind of misinformation sows distrust ahead of US election day,Technology,"Rumours, misleading allegations and outright lies about voting and fraud are flooding online spaces in unprecedented numbers in advance of the US election.Hundreds of incidents involving purported voting irregularities are being collected and spread by individuals, as well as both independent and Republican-affiliated groups. A small number of posts are also coming from Democrats.The US government has also alleged that foreign actors, including Russia, are spreading fake videos to undermine confidence in the electoral process.The whirlwind of misinformation spreading online poses a challenge to election officials who are having to debunk rumours and reassure voters, while preparing to administer election day on Tuesday.
Many posts alleging election irregularities support the Trump campaign’s false claim that the former president won the 2020 election and suggestions that he will potentially be cheated out of victory again on 5 November. When asked whether he will accept the 2024 election result, Donald Trump said during the presidential debate in September that he would if it was a ""fair and legal and good election"". A majority of Americans - 70% - expect him to reject the result if he loses, according to a CNN/SSRS poll released Monday.Just this week, Trump himself claimed widespread fraud in a key swing state.“Pennsylvania is cheating, and getting caught, at large scale levels rarely seen before,” Trump posted on his Truth Social network. “REPORT CHEATING TO AUTHORITIES. Law Enforcement must act, NOW!”The allegation followed officials in three Pennsylvania counties saying they were working with local law enforcement to investigate some voter registration applications for potential fraud.While Trump and allies seized on the announcements, the state's top election official, Republican Al Schmidt, has urged caution and warned voters to be aware of ""half-truths"" and disinformation circulating on social media.“This is a sign that the built-in safeguards in our voter registration process are working,” he said. 
The BBC has seen hundreds of allegations of election fraud online, on social networks and on message boards and in chat groups. Some of these posts have been viewed millions of times each.The posts have implied it's easy for non-citizens to vote, made false claims about voting machines and sowed distrust in the ballot-counting process.One video claimed to show recently-arrived Haitians voting in Georgia.The BBC has found clear indications, including false addresses and stock photos, which indicate the video is a fake. On Friday US security officials said it was made by ""Russian influence actors"".Another person on X claiming they were Canadian posted a picture of a ballot and said: “Figured I would drive across the border and vote.""It, too, is a fake, and part of an effort co-ordinated on the fringe message board 4chan. The ballot shown is from Florida, a state that requires identification to vote in person and is about a 20-hour drive from the Canadian border.Meanwhile in Northampton County, Pennsylvania, a video was posted on X showing a man dropping off a container of ballots at a courthouse, alleging suspicious activity. It turned out he was a postal worker delivering mail-in ballots, but the video was seen more than five million times.
Experts worry the burst of misinformation just before election day could undermine people's trust in the results - or lead to threats and violence in the lead-up to the election and beyond.It's happened before. In the hours and days that followed the 2020 presidential election, while votes were still being counted, then-President Trump turned to social media to allege fraud and falsely claim that he was the real winner of the election. ""Stop the steal"" became a slogan of his supporters' movement to overturn the results.Election polls - is Harris or Trump ahead?On social media, chatrooms and during street protests, conspiracy theorists alleged widespread voter fraud, culminating with a riot at the US Capitol on 6 January 2021.Meanwhile, in battleground states like Georgia, election officials - civil servants whose job it is to oversee the election - faced death threats.While false claims about voting ramped up after the 2020 vote, groups that monitor this kind of activity say this year it has started well before election day.Wendy Via, founder of the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism (GPAHE), said some far-right and right-wing activists “are preparing themselves for the election to be stolen in a way they weren’t in 2020”.“We cannot overstate the role of conspiracy theories in all of this,” she said.These doubts have already reached Trump supporters on the ground. At a rally this week in Wisconsin, another key swing state, a number of people said they believed only illegal activity would prevent the Republican nominee from winning.“I feel very confident about Trump, as long as there’s no cheating,” said Brad Miller of Green Bay, who mentioned that he’d already heard rumours about fraud. “Our only hope is that it’s not big enough to change the result.”After the 2020 election, dozens of court cases alleging election fraud were lodged by Trump's team across multiple states, but none succeeded.
Experts say that isolated incidents of ballot fraud and administrative errors always happen in US presidential elections, which run across all 50 states and in 2020 involved more than 150 million voters. But real incidents are now being catalogued and shared online to an unprecedented degree and being used, alongside fake posts, as evidence of widespread cheating.In southern California, dozens of ballots were found in a storm drain. Despite the unknown circumstances around the event, online partisans immediately suspected deliberate fraud.“They WILL cheat,” says one of the thousands of comments posted.
As cases have cropped up in recent days - including those in Pennsylvania and a Chinese student being charged with illegally voting in Michigan - authorities have repeatedly pointed to their investigations as examples of the robustness of election safeguards.But those who believe conspiracy theories about widespread fraud see these incidents as evidence of a co-ordinated plan by Democrats to “rig” the election.“Look at this new cheat voter fraud,” read one typical comment responding to the news from Pennsylvania. “Dems already doing their best to steal another election.”The overall effect can have a disastrous impact on trust in democracy, experts say.“These incidents are catnip for those who seek to undermine confidence in the election result,” said Luis Lozada, chief executive of Democracy Works, a not-for-profit group that distributes information about voting.

The mass of election fraud claims spreading on social media have been aided by a network of groups that crowdsource allegations.Groups like Texas-based True The Vote, founded in 2009, have long been on the forefront of questioning election security.On an app developed by True the Vote called VoteAlert, supporters post examples of alleged election irregularities.They have collected a wide range of claims, from minor security oversights to allegations of deliberate vote tampering. The organisation also has people monitoring live-streamed cameras that have been pointed on ballot drop boxes in a number of states. Many local officials have repeatedly outlined the steps they have taken to make the boxes secure.“Our hope is we see exactly nothing at these drop boxes,” said True the Vote founder Catherine Engelbrecht during one of her recent regular online meetings for supporters.But she also hinted that Democratic-aligned groups were aiming to commit election fraud on a vast scale.“If they want to try to pull the kinds of things that we saw being pulled in 2020, they’re highly unlikely to get away with it because we have, literally, eyes everywhere,” she added.The BBC contacted True the Vote for comment.A number of other groups are asking supporters to report alleged irregularities.Elon Musk’s America political action committee has started a community – akin to a message board – on X, filled with rumours and allegations about voting. With 50,000 members, several posts go up every minute, almost around the clock.Other efforts include the Election Integrity Network, a group founded by a former Trump lawyer who is challenging voter registrations and recruiting poll watchers – partisan observers who attend polling places.The volume of messages on these platforms – along with the vagueness of some of the claims, with often anonymous sources – makes it nearly impossible to verify each allegation.The groups, and the Trump campaign, say that these efforts are solely meant to ensure the integrity of the vote. The BBC contacted the Trump campaign for comment.
The effect of this is unpredictable.The Department of Homeland Security, in a memo reported on by US outlets including the BBC’s partner CBS, said on Monday that election conspiracy theories could spark action by domestic extremists.And observers expect the wave of misinformation to continue well beyond election day. Polls suggest the election will be among the closest in modern US history. It may take days to count all the votes and determine the winner.Luis Lozada of Democracy Works says the election is being conducted in an “ecosystem of distrust”.But despite the doubts being sown, he says, “accurate information is getting out there"".“Election officials work very hard to ensure that elections are run properly, as they were in 2020,” Mr Lozada said. “That’s not going to stop folks from taking anecdotes, and trying to punch holes.”With reporting by BBC Verify

11,"article,news",, DNA-testing site 23andMe fights for survival,Technology,"Three years ago, the DNA-testing firm 23andMe was a massive success, with a share price higher than Apple's.But, from those heady days of millions of people rushing to send it saliva samples in return for detailed reports about their ancestry, family connections and genetic make-up, it now finds itself fighting for its survival.Its share price has plummeted and this week it narrowly avoided being delisted from the stock market.And of course this is a company that holds the most sensitive data imaginable about its customers, raising troubling questions about what might happen to its huge – and extremely valuable – database of individual human DNA.When contacted by the BBC, 23andMe was bullish about its prospects - and insistent it remained ""committed to protecting customer data and consistently focused on maintaining the privacy of our customers.""But how did what was once one of the most talked-about tech firms get to the position where it has to answer questions about its very survival?
Not so long ago, 23andMe was in the public eye for all the right reasons.Its famous customers included Snoop Dogg, Oprah Winfrey, Eva Longoria and Warren Buffett - and millions of users were getting unexpected and life-changing results.Some people discovered that their parents were not who they thought they were, or that they had a genetic pre-disposition to serious health conditions.  Its share price rocketed to $321.Fast forward three years and that price has slumped to just under $5 - and the company is worth 2% of what it once was.What went wrong?
According to Professor Dimitris Andriosopoulos, founder of the Responsible Business Unit at Strathclyde University, the problem for 23andMe was twofold.  Firstly, it didn’t really have a continuing business model – once you’d paid for your DNA report, there was very little for you to return for. Secondly, plans to use an anonymised version of the gathered DNA database for drug research took too long to become profitable, because the drug development process takes so many years.That leads him to a blunt conclusion: “If I had a crystal ball, I’d say they will maybe last for a bit longer,” he told the BBC.“But as it currently is, in my view, 23andMe is highly unlikely to survive.”
The problems at 23andMe are reflected in the turmoil in its leadership.The board resigned in the summer and only the CEO and co-founder Anne Wojcicki – sister of the late YouTube boss Susan Wojcicki and ex-wife of Google co-founder Sergei Brin – remains from the original line-up.Rumours have swirled that the firm will shortly either fold or be sold - claims that it rejects.""23andMe’s co-founder and CEO Anne Wojcicki has publicly shared she intends to take the company private, and is not open to considering third party takeover proposals,"" the company said in a statement.But that hasn’t stopped the speculation, with rival firm Ancestry calling for US competition regulators to get involved if 23andMe does end up for sale.
Companies rising and falling is nothing new - especially in tech. But 23andMe is different.""It's worrying because of the sensitivity of the data,"" says Carissa Veliz, author of Privacy is Power.And that is not just for the individuals who have used the firm.""If you gave your data to 23andMe, you also gave the genetic data of your parents, your siblings, your children, and even distant kin who did not consent to that,"" she told the BBC.David Stillwell, professor of computational social science at Cambridge Judge Business School, agrees the stakes are high.“DNA data is different. If your bank account details are hacked, it will be disruptive but you can get a new bank account,"" he explained.""If your (non-identical) sibling has used it, they share 50% of your DNA, so their data can still be used to make health predictions about you.”The company is adamant these kinds of concerns are without foundation.""Any company that handles consumer information, including the type of data we collect, there are applicable data protections set out in law required to be followed as part of any future ownership change,"" it said in its statement.""The 23andMe terms of service and privacy statement would remain in place unless and until customers are presented with, and agree to, new terms and statements.""There are also legal protections which apply in the UK under its version of the data protection law, GDPR, whether the firm goes bust or changes hands.Even so, all companies can be hacked - as 23andMe was 12 months ago.And Carissa Veliz remains uneasy - and says ultimately a much robust approach is needed if we want to keep our most personal information safe.""The terms and conditions of these companies are typically incredibly inclusive; when you give out your personal data to them, you allow them to do pretty much anything they want with it,"" she said.""Until we ban the trade in personal data, we are not well protected enough.""Additional reporting by Tom Gerken

12,"article,news",,Hunt for Bitcoin's elusive creator hits another dead end,Technology,"Bitcoin underpins a two trillion-dollar cryptocurrency industry, is now traded by the world's biggest investment houses and is even an official currency in one country.But despite its meteoric rise, a deep mystery remains at its heart: what is the true identity of its founder, the elusive Satoshi Nakamoto?Many have tried to answer that question, but so far all have failed. In October, a high-profile HBO documentary suggested that a Canadian bitcoin expert called Peter Todd was he. The only problem: he said he was not, and the crypto world largely shrugged it off.So, inevitably, ears pricked up across our newsroom - and the crypto world at large - when on Thursday a call went out that the mysterious creator of Bitcoin was to, finally, unmask himself at a press conference. There is deep interest in who Satoshi Nakamoto is in part because they are considered a revolutionary programmer who helped spawn the crypto industry.Their voice, opinions and world view would be extremely influential on an industry with such a devoted and zealous fanbase. But the fascination also stems from the fact that, as the holder of more than one million bitcoins, Satoshi would be a multi-billionaire, not least because the price of the coins is currently close to an all-time high.Given that vast wealth, it was somewhat unusual to be asked by the organiser of Thursday’s press conference to pay for my seat at his grand unveiling. A front row seat would be £100. It was another £50 if I wanted unlimited questions. Organiser Charles Anderson even encouraged me to spend £500 in exchange for the privilege of interviewing ""Satoshi"" on stage.I declined.Mr Anderson said I could come along any way but cautioned there might not be a seat for me, such was the level of anticipation. As it happened, seating wasn’t a problem.
Only around a dozen reporters turned up to the prestigious Frontline Club - which interrupted proceedings at one point to stress it only provided a room, and not any official endorsement.Very soon it became clear that all attendees were extremely sceptical.After some digging it emerged both the organiser and the purported Satoshi were currently embroiled in a complex legal fight over fraud allegations - linked to claims to be Satoshi.It was an unpromising start, and things only got worse from there.Mr Anderson invited ""Satoshi"" to come on stage. A man called Stephen Mollah, who had been sat silently on the side the whole time walked up and resolutely declared: “I am here to make a statement that yes: I am Satoshi Nakamoto and I created the Bitcoin on Blockchain technology.”Over the following hour, reporters went from amused to irritated as he failed to provide any of the promised evidence for his claims.Mr Mollah promised that he would make the Hail-Mary move of unlocking and interacting with the first-ever Bitcoins to be created - something that only Satoshi could do. But he didn't.I departed, along with other bemused reporters, taking with us any lingering doubts that this would prove to be yet another dead-end in the quest to unmask Satoshi.
The list of those identified - unsuccessfully - as Satoshi Nakamoto is long.In 2014, a high-profile article in Newsweek said it was Dorian Nakamoto, a Japanese-American man living in California.But he denied it and the claim has largely been debunked.A year later, Australian computer scientist Craig Wright was outed as Satoshi by reporters. He denied it, before saying it was true - but then failed over many years to produce any evidence.In the spring the High Court in London ruled that Mr Wright was not the inventor.
Tech billionaire and crypto enthusiast Elon Musk also denied he was behind the cryptocurrency after a former employee at one of his firms, SpaceX, suggested it.Which brings us to the question: does it really matter?The crypto market's current valuation means it is worth more than Google. And it seems inconceivable that the tech giant would play such a big role in our lives without people knowing who founded it, and owned a sizeable chunk of the firm.Perhaps there’s good reason for the real Satoshi to keep schtum though. That bitcoin stash would make them worth an estimated $69bn and their life and character would no doubt be heavily scrutinised if they were found.  Peter Todd, who was named by the HBO documentary as being Satoshi, said the unwelcome attention he's received has made him fearful for his safety.Many in the crypto world enjoy the fact that the mystery remains unsolved. ""No-one knows who Satoshi is and that's a good thing,"" Adam Back, one of its core developers (and another potential Satoshi candidate) posted on X recently.Natalie Brunell, a Bitcoin podcaster, thinks Satoshi's anonymity is not only deliberate but essential.""By concealing his true identity, Satoshi ensured that Bitcoin wouldn’t have a leader or central figure, whose personal agenda could influence the protocol,"" she told me.""This allows people to trust Bitcoin as a system, rather than placing their trust in an individual or company.""Carol Alexander, professor of finance at Sussex University - who lectures on the history of Bitcoin - is less sure.In her view, the circus around who Satoshi Nakamoto is distracts from people looking into - and getting to grips with - the more serious question of how cryptocurrencies might upend the way the economy works.As I left the Frontline Club it was hard to compute the bizarre press event, beyond one obvious fact.For now - and perhaps forever - the search for Satoshi continues.

13,"article,news",,Law firm finds grooming claims against MrBeast co-host baseless,Technology,"Lawyers hired by MrBeast to investigate claims that his former co-host groomed a teenager have concluded that the allegations were ""without basis"", the star YouTuber has said. Ava Kris Tyson stopped working with MrBeast in July after other YouTubers accused her of sending inappropriate messages to a minor, reportedly then 13, when she was 20.At the time, Tyson apologised for her ""past actions"", but said her behaviour never ""extended beyond bad edgy jokes"" and denied ever grooming anyone. The alleged victim - who was named online - also defended her, saying the claims were ""massive lies"" and that they had never been ""exploited or taken advantage of"".
MrBeast, 26, real name Jimmy Donaldson, hosts the largest channel on YouTube, with 325m subscribers, and is known for making videos of stunts, challenges and acts of philanthropy.Tyson, 28, who last year came out as transgender, has appeared regularly on the channel since it was launched in 2012.After the initial claims in July, MrBeast said he was “disgusted” by the ""serious allegations of Ava Tyson's behaviour online"" and ""opposed to such unacceptable acts"".On Friday, he shared a letter on X from Quinn Emanuel Urqhart & Sullivan LLP, the law firm he hired to conduct an investigation into the claims. The letter said the firm had conducted 39 interviews with current and former employees of MrBeast's company and reviewed over 4.5m documents collected from mobile phones, e-mails, and a variety of messaging platforms. ""Allegations of sexual misconduct... between company employees and minors are without basis. The allegations were soundly rejected, including by alleged victims,"" it said. It added that allegations the company had knowingly employed ""individuals with proclivities or histories towards illegal... conduct"" were ""similarly without basis"". The letter said some ""isolated instances of workplace harassment and misconduct were identified"" and that, once informed about them, the company had taken ""swift and appropriate actions"". Following the publication of the letter, the alleged victim of Tyson's behaviour said again that the claims were ""completely false"". ""People used my name to make very serious allegations and claims without ever speaking to me,"" they said. ""It was incredibly difficult having my name thrown around in a public forum without being given the opportunity to share the truth.""The private investigators reviewed all my [direct messages] and interactions with Kris.""I was not groomed. These were false allegations made up by other people with my name thrown in them.""
Responding to the initial allegations in July, Tyson apologised for her ""unacceptable social media posts, past actions, and to those who may feel betrayed by how I used to act online"", but added: ""I never groomed anyone"".""To lump these two factors together to create a narrative that my behavior extended beyond bad edgy jokes is disgusting and did not happen,"" she said.""I have learned that my old humor is not acceptable. I cannot change who I was, but I can continue to work on myself.""

14,"article,features",,How Google tells you what you want to hear,Future,"""We're at the mercy of Google."" Undecided voters in the US who turn to Google may see dramatically different views of the world – even when they're asking the exact same question.
Type in ""Is Kamala Harris a good Democratic candidate"", and Google paints a rosy picture. Search results are constantly changing, but last week, the first link was a Pew Research Center poll showing that ""Harris energises Democrats"". Next is an Associated Press article titled ""Majority of Democrats think Kamala Harris would make a good president"", and the following links were similar. But if you've been hearing negative things about Harris, you might ask if she's a ""bad"" Democratic candidate instead. Fundamentally, that's an identical question, but Google's results are far more pessimistic.
""It's been easy to forget how bad Kamala Harris is,"" said an article from Reason Magazine in the top spot. Then the US News & World Report offered positive spin about how Harris isn't ""the worst thing that could happen to America"", but the following results are all critical. A piece from Al Jazeera explained ""Why I am not voting for Kamala Harris"", followed by an endless Reddit thread on why she's no good.
You can see the same dichotomy with questions about Donald Trump, conspiracy theories, contentious political debates and even medical information. Some experts say Google is just parroting your own beliefs right back to you. It may be worsening your own biases and deepening societal divides along the way.
""We're at the mercy of Google when it comes to what information we're able to find,"" says Varol Kayhan, an associate professor of information systems at the University of South Florida in the US.
""Google's whole mission is to give people the information that they want, but sometimes the information that people think they want isn't actually the most useful,"" says Sarah Presch, digital marketing director at Dragon Metrics, a platform that helps companies tune their websites for better recognition from Google using methods known as ""search engine optimisation"" or SEO.
It's a job that calls for meticulous combing through Google results, and a few years ago, Presch noticed a problem. ""I started looking at how Google handles topics where there's heated debate,"" she says. ""In a lot of cases, the results were shocking.""
Some of the starkest examples looked at how Google treats certain health questions. Google often pulls information from the web and shows it at the top of results to provide a quick answer, which it calls a Featured Snippet. Presch searched for ""link between coffee and hypertension"". The Featured Snippet quoted an article from the Mayo Clinic, highlighting the words ""Caffeine may cause a short, but dramatic increase in your blood pressure."" But when she looked up ""no link between coffee and hypertension"", the Featured Snippet cited a contradictory line from the very same Mayo Clinic article: ""Caffeine doesn't have a long-term effect on blood pressure and is not linked with a higher risk of high blood pressure"".
The same thing happened when Presch searched for ""is ADHD caused by sugar"" and ""ADHD not caused by sugar"". Google pulled up Featured Snippets that argue support both sides of the question, again taken from the same article. (In reality, there's little evidence that sugar affects ADHD symptoms, and it certainly doesn't cause the disorder.)
She encountered the same issue with political questions. Ask ""is the British tax system fair"", and Google cites a quote from Conservative MP Nigel Huddleston, arguing that indeed it is. Ask ""is the British tax system unfair"", and Google's Featured Snippet explains how UK taxes benefit the rich and promote inequality.
""What Google has done is they've pulled bits out of the text based on what people are searching for and fed them what they want to read,"" Presch says. ""It's one big bias machine.""
For its part, Google says it provides users unbiased results that simply match people with the kind of information they’re looking for. ""As a search engine, Google aims to surface high-quality results that are relevant to the query you entered,"" a Google spokesperson says. ""We provide open access to a range of viewpoints from across the web, and we give people helpful tools to evaluate the information and sources they find.""
By one estimate, Google handles some 6.3 million queries every second, totaling more nine billion searches a day. The vast majority of internet traffic begins with a Google Search, and people rarely click on anything beyond the first five links – let alone venturing onto the second page. One study that tracked users' eye movements found people often don't even look at anything past the top results. The system that orders the links on Google Search has colossal power over our experience of the world.
According to Google, the company is handling this responsibility well. ""Independent academic research has refuted the idea that Google Search is pushing people into filter bubbles,"" the spokesperson says. 
The question of so-called ""filter bubbles"" and ""echo chambers"" on the internet is a hot topic, though some research has questioned whether the effects of online echo chambers have been overstated.
But Kayhan – who has studied how search engines affect confirmation bias, the natural impulse to seek information that confirms your beliefs – says there's no question that our beliefs and even our own political identities are swayed by the systems that control what we see online. ""We're dramatically influenced by how we receive information,"" he says.
Google's spokesperson says a 2023 study which concluded that people's exposure to partisan news is due more to the fact that that's what they click on, rather than Google serving up partisan news in the first place. In one sense, that's how confirmation bias works: people look for evidence that supports their views and ignore evidence that challenges them. But even in that study, the researchers said their findings do not imply that Google's algorithms are unproblematic. ""In some cases, our participants were exposed to highly partisan and unreliable news on Google Search,"" the researchers said, ""and past work suggests that even a limited number of such exposures can have substantial negative impacts"".
Regardless, you might choose to engage with information that keeps you trapped in your filter bubble, ""but there's only a certain bouquet of messages that are put in front of you to choose from in the first place"", says Silvia Knobloch-Westerwick, a professor of mediated communication at Technische Universität Berlin in Germany. ""The algorithms play a substantial role in this problem.""
Google did not respond to the BBC's question whether there's a person or a team who's specifically tasked with addressing the problem of confirmation bias.
""In my opinion, this whole issue stems from the technical limitations of search engines, and the fact that people don't understand what those limitations are,"" says Mark Williams-Cook, founder of AlsoAsked, another search engine optimisation tool that analyses Google results.
A recent US anti-trust case against Google uncovered internal company documents where employees discuss some of the techniques the search engine uses to answer your questions. ""We do not understand documents – we fake it,"" an engineer wrote in a slideshow used during a 2016 presentation at the company. ""A billion times a day, people ask us to find documents relevant to a query… Beyond some basic stuff, we hardly look at documents. We look at people. If a document gets a positive reaction, we figure it is good. If the reaction is negative, it is probably bad. Grossly simplified, this is the source of Google's magic.""
""That is how we serve the next person, keep the induction rolling, and sustain the illusion that we understand.""
In other words, Google watches to see what people click on when they enter a given search term. When people seem satisfied by a certain type of information, it's more likely that Google will promote that kind of search result for similar queries in the future.
A Google spokesperson says these documents are outdated, and the system used to decipher queries and web pages has become far more sophisticated.
""That presentation is from 2016, so you have to take it with a pinch of salt, but the underlying concept is still true. Google builds models to try and predict what people like, but the problem is this creates a kind of feedback loop,"" Williams-Cook says. If confirmation bias pushes people to click on links that reinforce their beliefs, it can teach Google to show people links that lead to confirmation bias. ""It's like saying you're going to let your kid pick out their diet based on what they like. They'll just end up with junk food,"" he says.
Williams-Cook also worries that people may not understand that when you ask something like ""is Trump a good candidate"", Google may not necessarily interpret that as a question. Instead, it often just pulls up documents that relate to keywords like ""Trump"" and ""good candidate"".
It gives people mistaken expectations about what they're going to get when they're searching, and that can push people to misinterpret what the search results mean, he says.
If users were more clear on the search engine's shortcomings, Williams-Cook believes they might think about the content they see more critically. ""Google should do more to inform the public about how Search actually works. But I don't think they will, because to do that you have to admit some imperfections about what's not working,"" he says. (To learn more about the inner workings of search engines, read this article about how Google's updates to its algorithm are changing the internet.)
Google is open about the fact that Search is never a solved problem, a company spokesperson says, and the company works tirelessly to address the deep technical challenges in the field as they crop up. Google also points to features it offers that help users evaluate information, such as the ""About this result"" tool and notices that let users know when results about a topic related to breaking news are changing quickly.
Google's spokesperson says it's easy to find results reflecting a range of viewpoints from sources all across the web, if that's what you want to do. They argue that's true even with some of the examples Presch pointed out. Scroll further down with questions like ""is Kamala Harris a good Democratic candidate"", and you'll find links that criticise her. The same goes for ""is the British tax system fair"" – you'll find search results that say it isn't. With the ""link between coffee and hypertension"" query, Google's spokesperson says the issue is complicated but the search engine surfaces authoritative sources that delve into the nuance.
Of course, this relies on people exploring past the first few results – the further down the page of results you go, the less likely users are to engage with the links. In the case of coffee related hypertension and the British tax system, Google also summarises the results and gives its own answer prominently with Featured Snippets – which may make it less likely that people will follow links further down in the search results.
For a long time, observers have described how Google is transitioning from a search engine to an ""answer engine,"" where the company simply gives you the information, rather than pointing you to outside sources. The clearest example is the introduction of AI Overviews, a feature where Google uses AI to answer search queries for you, rather than pulling up links in response. As the company put it, you can now ""Let Google do the searching for you"".
More like this: • Google just updated its algorithm. The Internet will never be the same • The failure that started the internet •The riddles humans can solve but computers can't
""In the past Google was showing you something that someone else has written, but now it's writing the answer itself,"" Williams-Cook says. ""It compounds all of these problems, because now Google has just one chance to get it right. It's a difficult move.""
But even if Google had the technical ability to address all of these problems, it isn't necessarily clear when or how they should intervene. You may want information that backs up a particular belief, and if so, Google is providing a valuable service by delivering it to you.
Many people are uncomfortable with the idea of one of the world's richest and most powerful companies making decisions about what the truth is, Kayhan says. ""Is this Google's job to fix it? Can we trust Google to fix itself? And is it even fixable? These are difficult questions, and I don't think anyone has the answer, "" he says. ""The one thing I can tell you for sure is that I don't think they're doing enough.""

15,"article,news",,"Snapchat most-used app for grooming, says UK charity",,"The messaging app Snapchat is the most widely-used platform for online grooming, according to police figures supplied to the children's charity the NSPCC.More than 7,000 Sexual Communication with a Child offences were recorded across the UK in the year to March 2024 - the highest number since the offence was created.Snapchat made up nearly half of the 1,824 cases where the specific platform used for the grooming was recorded by the police.The NSPCC said it showed society was ""still waiting for tech companies to make their platforms safe for children.""Snapchat told the BBC it had ""zero tolerance"" of the sexual exploitation of young people, and had extra safety measures in place for teens and their parents.
Becky Riggs, the National Police Chief’s Council lead for child protection, described the data as ""shocking.""""It is imperative that the responsibility of safeguarding children online is placed with the companies who create spaces for them, and the regulator strengthens rules that social media platforms must follow,"" she added.
The gender of the victims of grooming offences was not always recorded by police, but of the cases where it was known, four in five victims were girls.Nicki - whose real name the BBC is not using - was eight when she was messaged on a gaming app by a groomer who encouraged her to go on to Snapchat for a conversation.""I don't need to explain details, but anything that you can imagine happening happened in those conversation - videos, pictures. Requests of certain material from Nicki, etcetera,"" her mother, who the BBC is calling Sarah, explained.She then created a fake Snapchat profile pretending to be her daughter and the man messaged - at which point she contacted the police.She now checks her daughter's devices and messages on a weekly basis, despite her daughter objecting.""It's my responsibility as mum to ensure she is safe,"" she told the BBC.She said parents ""cannot rely"" on apps and games to do that job for them.
Snapchat is one of the smaller social media platforms in the UK - but is very popular with children and teenagers. That is ""something that adults are likely to exploit when they're looking to groom children,"" says Rani Govender, child safety online policy manager at the NSPCC.But Ms Govender says there are also ""problems with the design of Snapchat which are also putting children at risk."" Messages and images on Snapchat disappear after 24 hours - making incriminating behaviour harder to track - and senders also know if the recipient has screengrabbed a message. Ms Govender says the NSPCC hears directly from children who single out Snapchat as a concern.""When they make a report [on Snapchat], this isn't listened to, and that they're able to see extreme and violent content on the app as well,"" she told the BBC.A Snapchat spokesperson told the BBC the sexual exploitation of young people was ""horrific."" ""If we identify such activity, or it is reported to us, we remove the content, disable the account, take steps to prevent the offender from creating additional accounts, and report them to the authorities,"" they added.
The instances of recording grooming has been increasing since the offence of Sexual Communication with a Child came into force in 2017, reaching a new record high of 7,062 this year.Of the 1,824 cases where the platform was known in the last year, 48% were recorded on Snapchat.Reported grooming offences on WhatsApp rose slightly in the past year. On Instagram and Facebook, known cases have fallen over recent years, according to the figures. All three platforms are owned by Meta.WhatsApp told the BBC it has ""robust safety measures"" in place to protect people on its app.Jess Phillips, minister for safeguarding and violence against women and girls, said social media companies ""have a responsibility to stop this vile abuse from happening on their platforms"".In a statement, she added: “Under the Online Safety Act they will have to stop this kind of illegal content being shared on their sites, including on private and encrypted messaging services or face significant fines.""The Online Safety Act includes a legal requirement for tech platforms to keep children safe.From December, big tech firms will have to publish their risk assessments on illegal harms on their platforms.Media regulator Ofcom, which will enforce those rules, said: ""Our draft codes of practice include robust measures that will help prevent grooming by making it harder for perpetrators to contact children. ""We’re prepared to use the full extent of our enforcement powers against any companies that come up short when the time comes.""

16,"article,features",,Why Amazon's latest AI is named after a dog,Future,"Amazon has called its latest AI assistant Rufus. But what is the story behind this unusual moniker and how does it compare to the way other AIs have been named?
In Ancient Rome it was a sobriquet for those blessed with red hair. The ruddy complexion of Wiliam II of England – the third son of William the Conqueror – also earned him the same nickname. Today in the UK, the forename ""Rufus"" has acquired a somewhat blue-blooded air. But it is perhaps more common to hear it being hollered by dog-walkers out for a stroll with their furry friends due to its delightful onomatopoeic similarity to barking.
So, it may raise some eyebrows to learn that online retail giant Amazon has chosen to give its latest AI assistant the same name. In November 2024, it will be 10 years since Amazon announced its first voice-activated smart assistant Alexa. The name was apparently chosen in homage to the ancient Library of Alexandria in Egypt.
But the origins of the company's latest assistant's moniker are arguably far cuddlier – Rufus is named after Amazon's first ""office dog"".
Rufus now joins a growing list of AI assistants offered by big tech companies with obscure names. Google's Gemini originally had the project title ""Titan"", but was swapped for its current name by the DeepMind team who were developing it. Gemini is Latin for twins, pointing at the collaboration between the DeepMind and Google Research teams on the project, but also to the dual personality attributed to the Gemini zodiac sign.
The name for the recently launched Apple Intelligence – which is bringing AI features to the Cupertino-based tech giant's devices – doesn't take a genius to figure out. But its Siri digital assistant was named by Dag Kittlaus, the co-founder of the company that developed the voice-activated software, who named it after a Norwegian colleague before it was acquired by Apple. In Norwegian means ""beautiful woman who leads you to victory"", but the name was also easy to pronounce, according to Kittlaus.
Tales of Rufus ­– a charming Welsh corgi – date back to Amazon's earliest days.
It was 1996, in the midst of the dot com boom, not long after Susan and Eric Benson came to work at the two-year-old startup together. At the time, there were less than 20 employees at Amazon and Eric was the fifth engineer they hired. Susan was a journalist who would become the editorial voice of the pioneering online store. Working long hours as the company geared up to go public, the couple began bringing their two-year-old dog with them to the office.
It didn't take long for the canine to integrate into the working day: chasing down tennis balls in hallways, begging for treats from other workers, sleeping his way through meetings under tables, and using his paw (with a little human help) to launch features on the website. These include the algorithm that recommends books based on what others have read.
Rufus would go on to become the first face of Amazon's error page to alert users when things went wrong.   Long after the Bensons retired in 2001, Rufus continued to make appearances on campus with his dog sitter who still worked there. The dog lived to the ripe old age of 15 and helped to start the dog-friendly culture at Amazon that allows employees to bring their pets to work.
Today, Amazon has more than 10,000 dogs registered as ""working"" at the tech giant. Popular amenities on campuses around the world include decked out dog parks, unlimited treats, and meetups for furry friends.
Amazon is far from the only tech company to have embraced a dog friendly workplace. Google welcomes dogs at its offices and its canine-owning employees are known as Dooglers. The company's Mountain View campus even has a dog park called the Doogleplex.
Amazon also has an office building in downtown Seattle named after its first dog. The Rufus Building is where is where the company's AI-powered shopping assistant was developed and the root of its name, according to Rajiv Mehta, Amazon's vice president of search and conversational shopping.
""We did extensive research on the name Rufus from many marketplaces that Amazon operates in and overall, we found that it was a brand and a name that resonated with customers around the world,"" says Mehta.
Although Rufus passed away in 2009, his legacy lives on. Amazon has now launched its AI assistant in the US, India and the UK, to provide information to customers as they make purchasing decisions. It is intended to answer questions about products.
Although customers can talk to Rufus, the AI assistant does not yet have a voice and can only respond by text and images. Mehta declined to speculate whether it would be integrated with Alexa. ""I can't speak to plans on Alexa,"" he says. ""The teams are completely separate at this point.""
To date, Rufus has answered more than 100 million queries, says Mehta.
We asked Rufus for some more information about dogs. Its response was as heart-warming as the original Rufus:
""Dogs are one of the most beloved pets in the world. They are loyal, friendly and make great companions. Despite their differences, all dogs share a few key traits – they are affectionate, protective of their owners, and eager to please. Dogs require proper care, including regular exercise, grooming, and veterinary checkups. In return, they provide unconditional love and can even improve their owner's physical and mental health. Whether as a family pet or a working animal, dogs have been an integral part of human society for thousands of years.""
While we can't know how pleased the original Rufus would have been with this summary, he may well have mourned the omission of treats.

17,"article,news",,Russia fines Google more money than there is in entire world,Technology,"A Russian court has fined Google two undecillion roubles - a two followed by 36 zeroes - for restricting Russian state media channels on YouTube.In dollar terms that means the tech giant has been told to pay $20,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000.Despite being one of the world's wealthiest companies, that is considerably more than the $2 trillion Google is worth.In fact, it is far greater than the world’s total GDP, which is estimated by the International Monetary Fund to be $110 trillion.The fine has reached such a gargantuan level because - as state news agency Tass has highlighted - it is rapidly increasing all the time.According to Tass, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov admitted he ""cannot even pronounce this number"" but urged ""Google management to pay attention.""The company has not commented publicly or responded to a BBC request for a statement.
Russia media outlet RBC reports the fine on Google relates to the restriction of content of 17 Russian media channels on YouTube.While this started in 2020, it escalated after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine two years later.That saw most Western companies pull out of Russia, with doing business there also tightly restricted by sanctions.Russian media outlets were also banned in Europe - prompting retaliatory measures from Moscow.In 2022, Google’s local subsidiary was declared bankrupt and the company has stopped offering its commercial services in Russia, such as advertising.However, its products are not completely banned in the country.This development is the latest escalation between Russia and the US tech giant.In May, 2021, Russia’s media regulator Roskomnadzor accused Google of restricting YouTube access to Russian media outlets, including RT and Sputnik, and supporting ""illegal protest activity"".Then, in July, 2022, Russia fined Google 21.1bn rouble (£301m) for failing to restrict access to what it called ""prohibited"" material about the war in Ukraine and other content.There is virtually no press freedom in Russia, with independent news outlets and freedom of expression severely curtailed.

18,"article,news",,'Sickening' Molly Russell chatbots found on Character.ai,Technology,"Chatbot versions of the teenagers Molly Russell and Brianna Ghey have been found on Character.ai - a platform which allows users to create digital versions of people.Molly Russell took her life at the age of 14 after viewing suicide material online while Brianna Ghey, 16, was murdered by two teenagers in 2023.The foundation set up in Molly Russell's memory said it was ""sickening"" and an ""utterly reprehensible failure of moderation."" The platform is already being sued in the US by the mother of a 14-year-old boy who she says took his own life after becoming obsessed with a Character.ai chatbot.Character.ai told the BBC that it took safety seriously and moderated the avatars people created ""both proactively and in response to user reports.""""We have a dedicated Trust & Safety team that reviews reports and takes action in accordance with our policies,"" it added.
The firm says it deleted the chatbots, which were user generated, after being alerted to them.Andy Burrows, chief executive of the Molly Rose Foundation, said the creation of the bots was a ""sickening action that will cause further heartache to everyone who knew and loved Molly"".""It vividly underscores why stronger regulation of both AI and user-generated platforms cannot come soon enough,"" he said.Esther Ghey, Brianna Ghey's mother, told the Telegraph, which first reported the story, that it was yet another example of how ""manipulative and dangerous"" the online world could be.
Chatbots are computer programs which can simulate human conversation. The recent rapid development in artificial intelligence (AI) has led to them becoming much more sophisticated and realistic, prompting more companies to set up platforms where users can create digital ""people"" to interact with.Character.ai - which was founded by former Google engineers Noam Shazeer and Daniel De Freitas - is one such platform.It has terms of service which ban using the platform to ""impersonate any person or entity"" and in its ""safety centre"" the company says its guiding principle is that its ""product should never produce responses that are likely to harm users or others"".It says it uses automated tools and user reports to identify uses that break its rules and is also building a ""trust and safety"" team.But it notes that ""no AI is currently perfect"" and safety in AI is an ""evolving space"".Character.ai is currently the subject of a legal action brought by Megan Garcia, a woman from Florida whose 14-year-old son, Sewell Setzer, took his own life after becoming obsessed with an AI avatar inspired by a Game of Thrones character.According to transcripts of their chats in Garcia's court filings her son discussed ending his life with the chatbot.In a final conversation Setzer told the chatbot he was ""coming home"" - and it encouraged him to do so ""as soon as possible"".Shortly afterwards he ended his life.Character.ai told CBS News it had protections specifically focused on suicidal and self-harm behaviours and that it would be introducing more stringent safety features for under-18s ""imminently"".

19,"article,news",,Warning for parents over 'explicit' WhatsApp group,Technology,"Parents of school children have been warned about a WhatsApp group which has potentially exposed pupils to inappropriate and explicit material.Clacton County High School in Essex has advised parents to ensure their children do not join ""Add Everyone"", or to block and report it if they have.In a widely shared post on its Facebook page, the school says the WhatsApp group could ""put young people into dangerous and vulnerable situations"".The school has told the BBC that ""as far as we are aware, no students have joined this group"" and it was merely raising awareness.
The school’s post has been shared more than 1,000 times, including by parents who said their children had been affected - although the BBC has been unable to verify which school their children attend.One mother said: ""Parents beware - my son and lots of his friends have been added to this recently. Thankfully they all left and deleted it immediately. Absolutely disgusting and scary how easy it is for it to happen.""Another posted: ""My daughter was also added and came out straight away after they asked what school she goes too. She said lots of kids from her school was added as well.""A similar warning to parents has been posted by Clacton Coastal Academy.In a post on X, the academy said ""explicit images have been shared within this [WhatsApp] group and seen by students who are at other schools"", but added that ""this has not been reported within Clacton Coastal Academy"".The BBC has approached the school for comment.
Essex Police said it was seeking to clarify if any schools had reported the Add Everyone group to the force, but warned of the dangers of WhatsApp in more general terms.""We’re aware of a number of reports in Essex of people being added to groups and being sent illegal or abusive material,"" a police spokesperson said.""WhatsApp can be a great way to stay in touch with friends and family. However, it can be used by people all over the world to send unwanted and unsolicited criminal content.""The force added that anyone who wished to report such content could do so via its website.Clacton County High School has directed parents to the E-safety section of its website, which includes advice on how to stay safe on platforms such as WhatsApp and social media, including how to avoid being added to groups and how to block people.

20,"article,news",,What happened on a spooky paranormal investigation in Scotland?,Highlands & Islands,"Set in the Victorian-era heart of the Highland village of Strathpeffer is a beautiful pavilion.Built more than 140 years ago, its visitors have included suffragette Emmeline Pankhurst and The Beatles, after the band abandoned a gig in Dingwall.But after recent strange goings-on, there are some who believe the place is haunted.I joined BBC Scotland's The Social and paranormal investigators trying to unravel the mystery.
It's a warm autumn afternoon and we have Strathpeffer Pavilion to ourselves.Our group includes a team from Highland Paranormal, the north of Scotland's oldest established paranormal society. It has investigated more than 180 sites across Scotland.We're here because of seemingly unexplained events.On occasions, when the building was closed, internal CCTV activated and filmed what looked like mist rising in the hall and lights turning on and off in the bar.A decorator working alone also reported hearing doors slamming and then a growl in his ear.Paranormal investigators Liam Shand, Lyn Reid and Lindsay Dunn have been searching for proof of spirits.Liam says: ""As a group our philosophy is always to look for the logical.""If a door opens is it a draught? If we can't find that draught you then have to go down the route of did someone push that door?""
Near the main entrance we pass a photograph of a woman who could be our first ghost.Anne Hay-Mackenzie, Countess of Cromartie, was a key figure in Strathpeffer's transformation from a farm to a bustling spa resort.Wealthy Victorians travelled from as far as London believing the local sulphur and iron-rich water had healing powers.The countess helped plan the village and designed its pavilion.The aristocrat glares back from her photograph.Maybe she was pretending to be annoyed or was in bad mood at the time the picture was taken. It's said she had a deep dislike of her husband, the 3rd Duke of Sutherland.
Our group heads up to a balcony overlooking the hall. Men have reported feeling uncomfortable in this part of the building, and Highland Paranormal suspects the countess is the cause.The investigators have equipment they say can provide clues to potential paranormal activity.They have EMF meters to detect changes in electromagnetic fields, audio recorders and a camera.A set of dowsing rods are handed round for us to try.They are similar to divining rods some claim can be used to find water, and that UK water companies have used in the past to search for underground pipes.In paranormal investigations ghosts are asked to move the rods to answer ""yes"" and ""no"" to questions.BBC producer David Gray makes his first attempt at using the rods.After a few questions, he asks if there is a spirit could it point to where presenter Grace Nicoll is standing.The rods slowly swing towards Grace.”They like you,” says David.
Next, a spirit box is set up.It's an electronic system that rapidly shifts between AM frequencies as part of a process paranormal investigators claim can be manipulated by ghosts to form words. It fizzes with white noise punctuated by short bursts of music and words.Someone in our group asks if we should leave the balcony. The word ""yes"" crackles from the device.It's decided to bid the countess, if she's there, farewell and investigate a small upstairs attic on the other side of the hall.
Since arriving, we've been hearing soft thuds and knocks from that side of the building.Just the sunny day causing an old building to creak and groan, or something uncanny?We cross the hall. On its wooden floor the team has placed ""triggers"", clusters of objects that might be familiar to a ghost. For this investigation they include war medals and bandages.During World War One the pavilion was a US Navy hospital and the hall was lined with beds filled with casualties. It's been suggested a nurse and an injured sailor are among our spooks.Also on the floor are cat toys, little plastic balls that light up when touched.I accidentally kick one sending it skittering across the floor, and causing a brief moment of excitement before I apologetically explain it was me and not a ghost.
From a darkened corridor we climb a narrow, twisting flight of stairs to the attic.The room is small with a low roof and it's hot from the pavilion's heating.The spirit of a young person is said to haunt the attic and Liam soon reports a spike in activity on a meter.The dowsing rods are handed to Grace who, like David, has been trying them for the first time.She asks if the spirit is happy to see us. The rods cross indicating ""yes"".Grace asks if it can spin a rod, and it duly starts to spin rapidly. She asks if it can spin the other rod, and it too spins round and round.So, is the activity ghosts? Lyn and Lindsay say what we've encountered cannot be easily explained away, and believe in the possibility of at least three spirits.  
Hayley Stevens, a writer for The Skeptic magazine and a researcher of paranormal activity for about 20 years, suggests not.She says involuntary muscle movements can cause dowsing rods to move.""It's like why we close our eyes when we sneeze - things we don't do on purpose but our body does to respond to a situation,"" she says. ""I have this golden rule of ghost-hunting - if you have to touch something to allow the spirit to move it then it's you that's moving it.""Hayley says spirit boxes might pick up frequencies used by radio stations or taxi offices, creating an ""audio illusion"".""Humans are very good pattern-seekers and find meaning in the random,"" she says.Hayley adds: ""The power of expectation is always going to have a role here, and the power of suggestion.""If you are told a lady haunts a location the chances are you are going to interpret sounds as being associated with that ghost.""Both sceptic and believer could probably walk away from Starthpeffer satisfied.While we were packing up to leave there was a thud above us.The sound came from a vent where the attic is.An old building settling in the cool of the late afternoon, or a cheeky ghost saying ""cheerio""?

21,"article,news",,How X users can earn thousands from US election misinformation and AI images,Technology,"Some users on X who spend their days sharing content that includes election misinformation, AI-generated images and unfounded conspiracy theories say they are being paid ""thousands of dollars"" by the social media site.The BBC identified networks of dozens of accounts that re-share each other's content multiple times a day - including a mix of true, unfounded, false and faked material - to boost their reach, and therefore, revenue on the site.Several say earnings from their own and other accounts range from a couple of hundred to thousands of dollars.They also say they coordinate sharing each other’s posts on forums and group chats. ""It's a way of trying to help each other out,"" one user said.Some of these networks support Donald Trump, others Kamala Harris, and some are independent. Several of these profiles - which say they are not connected to official campaigns - have been contacted by US politicians, including congressional candidates, looking for supportive posts.On 9 October, X changed its rules so the payments made to eligible accounts with a significant reach are calculated according to the amount of engagement from premium users - likes, shares and comments - rather than the number of ads under their posts.Many social media sites allow users to make money from their posts or to share sponsored content. But they often have rules which allow them to de-monetise or suspend profiles that post misinformation. X does not have guidelines on misinformation in the same way.While X has a smaller user base than some sites, it has a significant impact on political discourse. It raises questions about whether X is incentivising users to post provocative claims, whether they’re true or not, at a highly sensitive moment for US politics.The BBC compared the approximate earnings reported by some of these X users with the amount they would be expected to earn, based on their number of views, followers and interactions with other profiles, and found them to be credible.Among the misleading posts shared by some of these networks of profiles were claims about election fraud which had been rebutted by authorities, and extreme, unfounded allegations of paedophilia and sexual abuse against the presidential and vice-presidential candidates.Some misleading and false posts that originated on X have also spilled on to other social media sites with a bigger audience, such as Facebook and TikTok.In one example, an X user with a small following says he created a doctored image purporting to show Kamala Harris working at McDonald's as a young woman. Other users then pushed evidence-free claims that the Democratic Party was manipulating images of its candidate.Unfounded conspiracy theories from X about the July assassination attempt on Donald Trump were also picked up on other social media sites.X did not respond to questions about whether the site is incentivising users to post like this, nor to requests to interview owner Elon Musk.
Freedom Uncut’s content creation lair - where he streams and makes videos - is decorated with fairy lights in the shape of an American flag. He says he is an independent, but would rather Donald Trump becomes president than Kamala Harris.Free - as his friends call him - says he can spend up to 16 hours a day in his lair posting on X, interacting with the network of dozens of content creators he’s a part of, and sharing AI-generated pictures. He does not share his full name or real identity because he says his family's personal information has been exposed online, leading to threats.He is by no means one of the most extreme posters, and has agreed to meet me and explain how these networks on X operate.He says he has had 11 million views over the past few months since he began posting regularly about the US election. He brings several up on the screen as we chat at his home in Tampa, Florida.
Some are obviously satire - Donald Trump looking like a character in The Matrix as he brushes aside bullets, or President Joe Biden as a dictator. Other AI images are less fantastical - including an image of someone on the roof of their flooded home as fighter jets pass by, with the comment: ""Remember that politicians don't care about you on November 5th.""The image echoes Mr Trump's claim that there were ""no helicopters, no rescue"" for people in North Carolina following Hurricane Helene. The claim has been rebutted by the North Carolina National Guard, which says it rescued hundreds of people in 146 flight missions.Freedom Uncut says he sees his images as “art” that sparks a conversation. He says he is “not trying to fool anybody” but that he can “do so much more by using AI”.Since his profile was monetised, he says he can make in the ""low thousands"" monthly from X: “I think it's become a lot easier for people to make money.”He adds that some users he knows have been making more than five figures and claims he could corroborate this by seeing the reach of their posts: ""It's at that point it really does become a job.""He says it is the “controversial” stuff that tends to get the most views - and compares this to “sensationalist” traditional media.
While he posts “provocative stuff”, he says it is “usually based in some version of reality”. But he suggests that other profiles he sees are happy to share posts they know not to be true. This, he says, is an easy “money-maker”.Freedom Uncut dismisses concerns about false claims influencing the election, claiming the government “spreads more misinformation than the rest of the internet combined”.He also says it is “very common” for local politicians to reach out to accounts like his on X for support. He says some of them have chatted to him about appearing on his live streams and spoken to him about creating and sharing memes, AI images and artwork for them.Could any of these posts - misleading or not - have a tangible impact this election?“I think that you're seeing that currently. I think that a lot of the Trump support comes from that,” he says.In Freedom Uncut’s view, there is “more trust in independent media” - including accounts sharing AI-generated images and misinformation - than in “some traditional media companies”.
Going head-to-head with the pro-Trump accounts Freedom Uncut describes are profiles such as Brown Eyed Susan, who has more than 200,000 followers on X.She is part of a network of “die-hard” accounts posting content multiple times every hour in support of Democratic candidate Kamala Harris. While she uses her first name, she does not share her surname because of threats and abuse she has received online.Speaking to me from Los Angeles, Susan says she never intended to start making money from her posts - or for her account’s reach to “explode”. Sometimes she posts and re-shares more than 100 messages a day - and her individual posts sometimes reach more than two million users each.She says she only makes money from her posts because she was awarded a blue tick, which marks paid users on the site and some prominent accounts. “I didn't ask for it. I can't hide it, and I can't return it. So I clicked on monetise,” she tells me, estimating she can make a couple of hundred dollars a month.
Aside from posting about policy, some of her most viral posts - racking up more than three million views - have promoted unfounded and false conspiracy theories suggesting the July assassination attempt was staged by Donald Trump.She acknowledges that a member of the crowd and the shooter were killed, but says she has genuine questions about Donald Trump’s injury, the security failings, and whether the incident has been properly investigated.“There's no way to get to the truth in this. And if they want to call it conspiratorial, they can,” she says. Susan also shares memes, some of which use AI, taking aim at the Republican contender. Several more convincing examples make him look older or unwell. She says these “illustrate his current condition”.Others show him looking like a dictator. She maintains that all her images are ""obvious"" fakes.Like Freedom Uncut, she says politicians, including congressional candidates, have contacted her for support, and she says she tries to “spread as much awareness” as she can for them.
Following a row over whether Kamala Harris once worked at McDonald's, a doctored image of her in the fast food chain's uniform was shared on Facebook by her supporters and went viral.When some pro-Trump accounts realised it was an edited photo of a different woman in the uniform, it triggered unfounded accusations that the image came from the Democratic Party itself.An account called “The Infinite Dude” on X appeared to be the first to share the image with the caption: “This is fake”. The person behind the image tells me his name is Blake and that he shared it as part of an experiment. His profile does not have nearly as many followers as the other accounts I have been talking to.When I ask for evidence that he doctored the image, he told me he has “the original files and creation timestamps”, but he did not share those with me as he says proof does not really matter.“People share content not because it's real, but because they want it to be real. Both sides do it equally - they just choose different stories to believe,” he says.
His political allegiance remains unclear and he says this “isn’t about politics”.X says online that its priority is to protect and defend the user's voice. The site adds manipulated media labels to some AI-generated and doctored video, audio and images. It also has a feature called Community Notes, which crowdsources fact-checking from users.During the UK election, X did take action over a network of accounts sharing faked clips that I investigated. In the US election campaign, however, I have received no response to my questions or requests to interview Elon Musk.That matters - because social media companies like his could affect what unfolds as voters head to the polls.
Marianna Spring investigated this story using her Undercover Voters - five fictional characters based on data from the Pew Research Centre - that allow her to interrogate what some different users are recommended on social media. Their social media accounts are private and do not message real people. Find out more about them here - and on the BBC Americast podcast on BBC Sounds.

22,"article,features",,The failure that started the internet,Future,"On 29 October 1969, two scientists established a connection between computers some 350 miles away and started typing a message. Halfway through, it crashed. They sat down with the BBC 55 years later.
At the height of the Cold War, Charley Kline and Bill Duvall were two bright-eyed engineers on the front lines of one of technology's most ambitious experiments. Kline, a 21-year-old graduate student at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), and Duvall, a 29-year-old systems programmer at Stanford Research Institute (SRI), were working on a system called Arpanet, short for the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network. Funded by the US Department of Defense, the project aimed to create a network that could directly share data without relying on telephone lines. Instead, this system used a method of data delivery called ""packet switching"" that would later form the basis for the modern internet.
It was the first test of a technology that would change almost every facet of human life. But before it could work, you had to log in.
Kline sat at his keyboard between the lime-green walls of UCLA's Boelter Hall Room 3420, prepared to connect with Duvall, who was working a computer halfway across the state of California. But Kline didn't even make it all the way through the word ""L-O-G-I-N"" before Duvall told him over the phone that his system crashed. Thanks to that error, the first ""message"" that Kline sent Duvall on that autumn day in 1969 was simply the letters ""L-O"".
They got their connection up and running about an hour later after some tweaks, and that initial crash was just a blip in an otherwise monumental achievement. But neither man realised the significance of the moment. ""I certainly didn't at that time,"" Kline says. ""We were just trying to get it to work.""
The BBC spoke to Kline and Duvall for the 55th anniversary of the occasion. Half a century later, the internet has shrunk the whole world down to a small black box that fits in your pocket, one that dominates our attention and touches the furthest reaches of lived experience. But it all started with two men, experiencing just how frustrating it is when you can't get online for the very first time.
This interview has been edited for clarity and length.
Can you describe the computers that enabled Arpanet? Were these massive, noisy machines?
Kline: They were small computers – by standards of that time – about the size of a refrigerator. They were somewhat noisy from the cooling fans, but quiet compared with the sounds from all the fans in our Sigma 7 computer. There were lights on the front that would blink, switches that could control the IMP [Interface Message Processor], and a paper tape reader that could be used to load the software.
Duvall: They were in a rack big enough to hold a complete set of sound equipment for a large show today. And they were thousands if not millions or billions of times less powerful than the processor in an Apple Watch. These were the old days!
Take us inside that moment when you started typing L-O.
Kline: Unlike websites and other systems today, when you connected a terminal to the SRI system nothing happened until you typed something. If you wanted to run a programme, you first needed to login – by typing the word ""login"" – and the system would ask for your user name and password.
As I typed a character on my terminal – a teletype model 33 – it would get sent from my terminal to the programme I wrote for the SDS Sigma 7 computer. That programme would take the character, format it into a message and send it to the Interface Message Processor. When it was received by SRI's system, [it] would treat [the message] as if it came from a local terminal and would process it. It would ""echo"" the character [replicate it on the terminal]. In this case, Bill's code would take that character and format it into a message and send it to the IMP to go back to UCLA. When I received it, I would print it on my terminal.
I was on the phone with Bill when we tried this. I told him I typed the letter L. He told me he had received the letter L and echoed it back. I told him that it printed. Then I typed the letter O. Again, it worked fine. I typed the letter G. Bill told me his system had crashed, and he would call me back.
Duvall: The UCLA system did not anticipate that it would receive G-I-N after Charlie had typed L-O, so it sent an error message to the SRI computer. I don't recall exactly what the message was, but what happened next was due to the fact that the network connection was much faster than anything seen before.
The normal connection speed was 10 characters per second whereas the Arpanet could transmit characters at up to 5,000 characters per second. The result of this message being sent from UCLA to the SRI computer flooded the input buffer which only expected 10 characters per second. It was like filling a glass with a fire hose. I quickly discovered what had happened, changed the buffer size and rebuilt the system, which took about an hour.
Did you realise this could be a historic moment?
Kline: No, I certainly didn't at that time.
Duvall: Not really. It was another step forward in the larger context of the work we were doing at SRI which we did believe would have a large impact.
When Samuel Morse sent the first telegraph message in 1844, he had an eye for drama, tapping out ""What hath God wrought"" on a line from Washington, DC to Baltimore, Maryland, US. If you could go back, would you have typed something more memorable?
Kline: Of course, if I had realised its importance. But we were just trying to get it to work.
Duvall: No. This was the first test of a very complicated system with a lot of moving parts. To have something this complex work in the very first test was dramatic in and of itself.
What was the atmosphere like when the message was sent?
Duvall: We were each alone in our respective computer laboratories at night. We were both happy to have had such a successful first test as the culmination of a lot of work. I went to a local ""watering hole"" and had a burger and a beer.
Kline: I was happy that it worked and went home to get some sleep.
What did you expect Arpanet to become?
Duvall: I saw the work we were doing at SRI as a critical part of a larger vision, that of information workers connected to each other and sharing problems, observations, documents and solutions. What we did not see was the commercial adoption nor did we anticipate the phenomenon of social media and the associated disinformation plague. Although, it should be noted, that in [SRI computer scientist] Douglas Engelbart's 1962 treatise describing the overall vision, he notes that the capabilities we were creating would trigger profound change in our society, and it would be necessary to simultaneously use and adapt the tools we were creating to address the problems which would arise from their use in society.
What aspects of the internet today remind you of Arpanet?
Duvall: Referring to the larger vision which was being created in Engelbart's group (the mouse, full screen editing, links, etc.), the internet today is a logical evolution of those ideas enhanced, of course, by the contributions of many bright and innovative people and organisations.
Kline: The ability to use resources from others. That's what we do when we use a website. We are using the facilities of the website and its programmes, features, etc. And, of course, email.
The Arpanet pretty much created the concept of routing and multiple paths from one site to another. That got reliability in case a communication line failed. It also allowed increases in communication speeds by using multiple paths simultaneously. Those concepts have carried over to the internet.
As we developed the communications protocols for the Arpanet, we discovered problems, redesigned and improved the protocols and learned many lessons that carried over to the Internet. TCP/IP [the basic standard for internet connection] was developed both to interconnect networks, in particular the Arpanet with other networks, and also to improve performance, reliability and more.
How do you feel about this anniversary?
Kline: That's a mix. Personally, I feel it is important, but a little overblown. The Arpanet and what sprang from it are very important. This particular anniversary to me is just one of many events. I find somewhat more important than this particular anniversary were the decisions by Arpa to build the Network and continue to support its development.
Duvall: It's nice to remember the origin of something like the internet, but the most important thing is the enormous amount of work that has been done since that time to turn it into what is a major part of societies worldwide.
The modern web is dominated not by government or academic researchers, but by some of the largest companies in the world. How do you feel about what the internet has become? What are you most concerned about?
Kline: We use it in our daily lives, and it is very important. It's hard to imagine ever not having it again. One of the benefits of it being so open and not controlled by a government is that new ideas can get developed, such as online shopping, banking, video streaming, news sites, social media, and more. But because it has become so important to our lives it is a target for malicious activity.
We hear constantly about how things have been compromised. There is a tremendous loss of privacy. And the big companies (Google, Meta, Amazon and internet service providers such as Comcast and AT&T) have too much power in my opinion. But I am not sure of the right remedy.
Duvall: I think that there is great danger in the domination by any single entity. We have seen the power of disinformation in directing policy and elections. We have also seen the power of companies in influencing the direction of social norms and the formation of adults and young adults.
Kline: One of my biggest fears has been about the spread of false information. How many times have you heard someone say, ""I saw it on the internet"". It was always possible to spread false information, but it would cost money to send out mailers, put up a billboard or take out a TV ad. Now it is cheap and easy. And as it reaches millions of people, it gets repeated and treated as fact.
Another fear is that as more and more critical systems have moved onto the internet it becomes easier to cause a serious disruption if those systems are taken down or compromised. For example, not only communications systems but banking, utilities, transportation, etc.
Duvall: It has great power but, not heeding Engelbart's warning in 1962, we have not effectively used the power of the internet to manage the social impact.
Are there any lessons from your time at Arpanet that could make it a better place for everyone?
Kline: While the openness of the internet allows experimentation and new uses, the lack of control can lead to compromises. Arpa kept some control of the Arpanet. That way they could make sure that everything worked, make decisions about which protocols were required, deal with issues such as site names and other issues.

While Icann [the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers] still manages some of that, there have been international disagreements about how to move forward and whether the US has too much control, etc. But we still need some controls to keep the network functional. Also, since the Arpanet was relatively small, we could experiment with major changes in design, protocols, and more. That would be extremely hard now.
Duvall: We are standing on the edge of a precipice with AI and the reflexive access it has to everyone who graces the internet. The internet had explosive growth and development – some of it socially damaging – in the early days. AI now stands at that threshold, and is inseparable from the internet. And it is not unreasonable to call AI an existential threat. The time to recognise the dangers as well as the promise is now.

23,"article,news",,Instagram lowering quality of less viewed videos 'alarming' creators,Technology,"Instagram disclosing that it lowers the quality of older, less popular videos has been criticised as ""alarming"" by creators.Some users of the Meta-owned social media platform expressed concern after its boss Adam Mosseri said it reserved higher quality for more popular content. ""We bias to higher quality... for creators who drive more views,"" Mr Mosseri wrote in a post on Threads on Sunday.One creator told the BBC this was ""disheartening"" for those who have pivoted to producing content for Instagram over other platforms.""I think it is incredibly harmful to the creative's art,"" said Siete Savone. The 25-year-old creator said she loved using the platform and understood its need to update and add new features.But she said it should draw the line with moves ""actually affecting the quality of someone's original artistic work"".""No one should have to worry about the quality of their content not being retained due to Instagram retaining an ""engagement bias"" in favour of creators with more visibility,"" she added.Mr Mosseri said Instagram reduced the quality of videos that had not been watched for a long time - saying most views occurred soon after publication.The platform would improve a video's quality again if it got more popular, he added.Social media consultant Matt Navarra told the BBC the move ""seems to somewhat contradict Instagram's earlier messages or efforts to encourage new creators"". ""How can creators gain traction if their content is penalised for not being popular,"" he said.And he said it could risk creating a cycle of more established creators reaping the rewards of higher engagement from viewers over those trying to build their following.""The playing field amongst small creators and big creators alike should be even,"" agreed Ms Siete.
Underlying Instagram's decision is the cost of streaming videos.Videos that have a higher resolution or contain lots of visual assets such as edits, images or other clips can demand more computing power to encode.These will typically be larger in size than videos in a smaller resolution, meaning they require more storage space on servers.And one person said in response to Mr Mosseri's post they understood the benefits of potentially reducing storage cost, but it did not outweigh the negatives.""From a creator’s perspective, spending time on creating high quality content just for it to be downgraded to low resolution sucks,"" they said.In May, Instagram announced changes to its system for recommending content, particularly video, to ""give all creators a more equal chance of breaking through"".However, Mr Navarra said he agreed with Mr Mosseri's assertion - when responding to user concerns about the impact on smaller creators - that people will always value a video's content over its quality.He said creators should focus on how they can make engaging content that caters to their audience, rather than be overly concerned by the possibility of its quality being degraded by Instagram.Mr Mosseri clarified to users on Sunday that Instagram does not decide to reduce or improve the quality of individual videos, but rather does so in an ""aggregate"" way and on a ""sliding scale"" - adding he believed the difference in quality ""isn't huge"".""The goal is to show people the highest quality content that we can,"" he said in his initial video response.The BBC has asked Instagram for more information.The social media platform's attempts to make video more key to its app experience have previously resulted in backlash from some users and creators.In 2022 it reversed plans to shift further away from its traditional photo or so-called ""grid"" post format towards a TikTok-style focus on short form video content after it was criticised by creators and celebrities including Kylie Jenner.

24,"article,news",,TikTok founder becomes China's richest man,Technology,"The surging global popularity of TikTok has seen the co-founder of its parent company, ByteDance, become China's richest person.According to a rich list produced by the Hurun Research Institute, Zhang Yiming is now worth $49.3bn (£38bn) - 43% more than in 2023.The 41-year-old stepped down from his role in charge of the company in 2021, but is understood to own around 20% of the firm.TikTok has become one of the most popular social media apps in the world, despite deep concerns in some countries about its ties to the Chinese state.While both companies insist they are independent of the Chinese government, the US intends to ban TikTok in January 2025 unless ByteDance sells it.Despite facing that intense pressure in the US, ByteDance's global profit increased by 60% last year, driving up Zhang Yiming's personal fortune.“Zhang Yiming is the 18th new Number One we have had in China in just 26 years,"" said head of Hurun Rupert Hoogewerf. ""The US, by comparison, has only four Number Ones: Bill Gates, Warren Buffett, Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk. ""This gives an indication of some of the dynamism in the Chinese economy.""
Mr Zhang is not the only representative of China's huge tech sector on the list.Pony Ma, boss of the tech conglomerate, Tencent, is third on the list with an estimated personal wealth amounting to £44.4bn.But their fortunes are not just explained by their companies successes - their rivals have made less in a year in which China's economy has sputtered.In fact, only approximately 30% of the people on the list had an increase in their net worth - the rest saw a decline.How did Zhang Yiming become one of the richest people on the planet?“The Hurun China Rich List has shrunk for an unprecedented third year running, as China’s economy and stock markets had a difficult year,"" said Mr Hoogewerf. ""The number of individuals on the list was down by 12% in the past year to just under 1100 individuals and 25% from the high point of 2021.""He said the data showed it had been a good year for smartphone manufacturers such as Xiaomi, while the green energy market had stumbled.“Solar panel, lithium battery and EV makers have had a challenging year, as competition intensified, leading to a glut, and the threat of tariffs added to uncertainties,"" he said. ""Solar panel makers saw their wealth down as much as 80% from the 2021 peak, whilst battery and EV makers were down by half and a quarter respectively.""

25,"article,news",,Apple's AI features roll out on iPhones - but not for all,Technology,"After a long wait, Apple has finally released its artificial intelligence (AI) tools for iPhone - to a select few.Apple Intelligence, a suite of AI tools announced in June, became available to owners of some iPhones around the world on Monday.It was accessible for people with eligible devices by updating to the latest version of Apple's operating system for iPhones.Those hoping to get hold of Apple Intelligence have to request to join a waitlist to get it after updating  to iOS 18.1.According to Apple, users should be able to activate its suite of AI tools ""within a few hours"" of joining its waitlist, though it does say wait times may differ.The new features include notification summaries, tools to assist users in writing messages, and a glowing new interface for virtual assistant Siri.But they will only be available to people with the latest devices - including all iPhone 16 models, and the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max.Apple Intelligence is also available on Mac computers and iPad tablets that are powered by its latest chips.But some of the tools made available on Monday have arrived later than equivalent features on other popular devices.Apple chief executive Tim Cook said the public release of its AI tools introduced “a new era"" for its products.It comes after the company said on Friday it would reward ethical hackers who could demonstrate vulnerabilities in its AI software with a bounty of up to $1m (£770,000).What is AI and how does it work?What's the point of buying the latest smartphone?The bundle of features released on Monday in its iOS 18.1 update are the first wave of AI tools previously shown off at Apple's summer developer conference.More features expected later this year include generating images and emoji from text prompts.
Google and Samsung have already introduced AI features to their devices.These include allowing users to translate conversations in real-time, automatically organise notes, and search for something online by drawing a circle around it.While initially making its Galaxy AI features available on its latest handsets, Samsung widened it to include S22 devices released in 2022.The South Korean tech giant said in February it planned to introduce Galaxy AI for more than 100 million users within 2024.Apple's new Clean Up tool, allowing people to remove unwanted objects or people from an image, also follows Google's previous release of a similar tool called Magic Eraser.Mr Cook told the Wall Street Journal in October that the company was ""perfectly fine with not being first”, adding it ""takes a while to get it really great"".

26,"article,news",,Can AI make life easier for people with dementia?,Technology,"Pete Middleton, who lives in Northamptonshire, UK with his wife, has long been an early adopter of technology.He became interested in computing while in the Royal Air Force in the 1980s and went on to learn several programming languages.In recent years he’s been enthusiastic about the rise of AI, which he uses for creating artwork and conducting research, for instance.Overall, Mr Middleton is having a busy retirement. In addition to his hobbies and his dementia blog, he’s a lived-experience consultant, committee member and volunteer with Alzheimer’s Society.Since his diagnosis with dementia five years ago, at the age of 65, he’s noticed changes to his short-term memory. For example, “I can still write apps for mobile phones, but I can’t remember where I put my telephone.”Mr Middleton believes that AI could help to bridge this gap.""If people incorporate the benefits of using AI into their lives, it will be good for their self-respect and self-esteem, and it will keep them independent for longer. And if it does that, it keeps them out of the NHS system and out of care homes.”
A number of AI-based tools offer to help with the daily routines of people living with dementia.One is Simon, an app that uses geo-tracking and machine learning to determine the specific needs of a user and provide notifications that could help.“For example, this could include reminding individuals of a PIN when the app detects they are at the bank,” says Fiona Carragher, the director of research and influencing at Alzheimer’s Society. Simon is currently being beta tested.A long-running programme in this domain is the Florence Project. The Florence Project seeks to develop useful communication technologies for people living with dementia.“We’re looking at this issue of keeping communication strong – so, not replacing communication between family and carers and people living with dementia, but rather supporting it,” says Janet Wiles, a professor in human-centred computing at Australia’s University of Queensland.
Prof Wiles, whose own mother lives with dementia, is part of a team working on the Florence Project.The team are keen to avoid their products ending up in a drawer of unused, overly complicated devices.So, it includes a Living Experience Expert Panel, made up of people living with dementia and those who help care for them.The project has developed three devices – a diary, a music player, and a digital photo screen. These are easy-to-use, single-function devices with physical elements like knobs or buttons, which also integrate the preferences of the living experience experts. The content on the devices can be adjusted either locally or remotely. For instance, a relative in another part of the country can update the playlist on the music player, if the person living with dementia gives permission.AI helps with personalising these tools. A knowledge bank is built for each person, based on questions they answer or conversations they have. Audio is transcribed and in some cases translated, before feeding into the kinds of information that are made available on the devices.For example, the diary device might display the photo of a new part-time carer next to the time that they will arrive.Needs and preferences may change as their condition does. So, for example, the information in the diary can be simplified to match the needs of the user.The team were keen not to rush the development process - the project has been running for about a decade already, and is now at the stage of testing its prototypes.""The downside for tech that goes wrong for people with dementia is often way worse than it would be for other people,” Prof Wiles cautions.She emphasises that data privacy and security are especially important for people with dementia.
AI-based chatbots are also being integrated into companion robots. Hiro-chan is a faceless, huggable, soft therapy robot; the researchers believe that interacting with Hiro-chan reduces stress in people with dementia.They’re now working on integrating ChatGPT into the robots, along with speakers and microphones. The total weight would remain less than 800 grams.In initial tests with people with dementia living in care homes, “we found that a simpler dialogue than we expected would be more engaging for more of them,” says Hidenobu Sumioka, a roboticist at Advanced Telecommunications Research Institute International in Kyoto.However, “it’s critical that AI doesn’t replace the human contact that is so important in dementia care,” Ms Carragher says. “Instead, it should be used to enhance care in a way that is beneficial to people living with dementia and their carers.”
Dennis Frost, a retired programmer who has served on the Florence Project’s Living Experience Expert Panel, points out that social engagement is very important for people who are diagnosed with dementia.“I would suggest increasing human interaction should be a priority over increasing AI interaction. After all would an AI actually care if I lived or died?”Mr Middleton sees great promise in AI, but emphasises that any technologies intended for people with dementia must be customisable to a diverse set of people.“No two people with dementia are the same,” Mr Middleton says. “What works for me won't work perhaps for my next-door neighbour, who has dementia.”“So developers must be very careful when they’re developing products to not just target the dementia community in general, but look for the specific stages of dementia and try and make up match up what they do with the person’s ability.”

27,"article,features",,How smartwatches are saving lives,Future,"Smartwatches gather vast amounts of data about our physiology. Now their technology is being harnessed like never before.
As the chief anaesthesiologist at CHUV University Hospital, Patrick Schoettker is all too aware of the complications which can follow a lengthy operation under general anaesthetic.
Rapid blood loss from the surgical site can send the patient into shock, triggering sudden and dangerous dips in blood flow through the body. But patients can also develop severe lung problems after many hours of deep sedation, a complication which accounts for a quarter of all deaths within the first six days of surgery.
Such tragedies sometimes occur due to underlying frailties in the patient's physiology which had gone undetected. But what if hospitals had a quick, low-cost way of screening for them ahead of major procedures? 
Schoettker and his colleagues are conducting a trial which involves fitting patients with a smartwatch known as the Masimo W1 several weeks ahead of their pre-operation consultation. The data it has collected is then used to form an assessment of their state of health.
The W1 provides continuous readings of heart rate, respiration rate, blood oxygen, pulse rate and even hydration levels, all to medical-grade accuracy. Schoettker describes the layers of information as being akin to a ""digital twin"", and believes it could help save lives.
""We plan to use this pre-operatively acquired data to predict possible pre or postoperative complications and act on them in a preventative way,"" says Schoettker. 
This is just one example of how the booming smartwatch market – some analysts have predicted that more than 400 million devices will be sold worldwide by 2027 – is opening up a bold new era of preventative health. Masimo, Apple, Samsung, Withings, FitBit and Polar have all developed watches capable of recording an extraordinary amount of data, allowing measurements such as sleep quality, blood pressure, heart rhythm variation and blood oxygen saturation levels – a marker of how well the heart and lungs are functioning – to be tracked in real-time.
Gosia Wamil, a consultant cardiologist at Mayo Clinic Healthcare in London, says that this information is already helping to alert doctors to potential health problems, enabling them to act sooner.
""More and more patients are willing to use their smartwatches to acquire some data, and then bring the printouts and results to us,"" says Wamil. ""And then we can investigate further and confirm those abnormalities.""
So far, some of the biggest applications have been related to heart health. In April this year, one study found that smartwatch-acquired electrocardiogram (ECG) measurements – readings of the heart's electrical activity – could reliably identify extra heart beats in otherwise healthy 50 to 70 year olds. This can be a warning sign of a much more serious condition, atrial fibrillation, where the heart starts beating irregularly or accelerating out of control without warning. 
Other research has found that AI algorithms can use Apple Watch ECG readings to identify people with a low ejection fraction – the amount of blood that your heart pumps each time it beats, which can be a key warning sign of heart failure – with 88% accuracy. Wamil says that this combination of machine learning platforms and smartwatch-derived data is likely to prove revolutionary for patients with all kinds of heart conditions.
""In cardiology clinics, we see patients who complain of palpitations, and we used to have those tapes which we could stick on their chest and record their ECG over 24 hours,"" says Wamil. ""Very frequently, patients may not have symptoms during those 24 hours. But with smartwatches, whenever the patient experiences symptoms, they can press a button on their watch, acquire an ECG and show that to us.""
Wamil says this is already leading to preventative treatment, enabling cardiologists to prescribe blood thinner tablets to patients with signs of an irregular heartbeat, to help prevent strokes. She is also interested in whether this data can be used to prevent some of the cardiovascular complications experienced by many type 2 diabetes patients.
""The reason why people with diabetes have shorter lives is because they are much more at risk of developing heart problems,"" says Wamil. ""We hope that in the future, this data could be used to detect early signs to alert the patient and doctor about their future risk of heart attacks and strokes.""
But many of the applications of smartwatches could extend far beyond the heart. In July 2023, researchers at Cardiff University published a study using data from more than 100,000 people, who were given a smartwatch to wear for a week. The results showed that it was possible to identify individuals with signs of Parkinson's disease up to seven years before their clinical diagnosis. This was done by detecting subtle abnormalities in their walking patterns, as measured by the watch's motion sensors. 
Cynthia Sandor, who led the study, believes it could be possible to pinpoint these signs even sooner through combining motion data with other smartwatch measurements such as sleep quality, which is known to be disturbed in people who develop the disease. 
""In Parkinson's, diagnosis is preceded by a long phase where signs such as subtle motor changes become apparent,"" says Sandor. ""We found that the most predictive feature was a slowing of movement during light physical activity, too subtle to be noticed by individuals themselves.""
Sandor believes this information could soon be used to recruit individuals to clinical trials. One of the theories for why effective treatments for Parkinson's have proven so elusive is because patients are diagnosed at a stage where significant brain damage has already occurred, and it may be easier to slow or even reverse the disease at an earlier stage. ""We hope that early screening tools based on smartwatch data can identify people early, potentially enabling neuroprotective treatment trials to be successful,"" she says.  
It is also hoped that smartwatches could one day soon help people living with chronic conditions such as epilepsy, through providing them with early warning signs that a seizure is about to occur. Falls and serious accidents resulting from seizures are known risk factors for those living with epilepsy. 
""The uncertainty of when seizures might occur is one of the most difficult aspects of living with epilepsy,"" says Aileen McGonigal of the Queensland Brain Institute. ""Seizure forecasting is however still at an early stage.""
McGonigal is interested in whether a special prototype version of the Empatica smartwatch designed for research can aid with seizure prediction. In an ongoing research project, she is applying AI algorithms to a combination of data streams. These include heart rate variability, skin temperature, body movement patterns and changes in the electrical conductance of the skin due to sweating, which reflects alterations in the body's autonomic nervous system. Each of these parameters can be measured by the watch.
""We aim to analyse patterns in the hours leading up to seizures,"" says McGonigal. ""Ideally epilepsy researchers and clinicians would like for patients to be able to forecast when seizures are more likely to occur, which might allow tailoring of treatment, including variable doses of medication and adaption of daily activities to reduce risk of seizure-related falls and injury,"" she says.
But while there is considerable excitement about what the combination of powerful AI algorithms and increasingly accurate wearable measurements might be able to achieve, some doctors are also cautious about the potential for false positives. There are concerns that the overuse of smartwatches could lead to an increase in patient anxiety, as well as testing the resources of already overstretched health systems.
""Technology is helping medicine in many different ways,"" says Jeremy Smelt, a consultant thoracic surgeon at St George's Hospital NHS Foundation Trust. ""One of them is the early detection of problems, but it can also save lives. As with all technologies, smartwatches have to be tried and tested. False positives will cause anxiety and may end up in people going to the GP when they don't need to. But they are also very interesting for those with health conditions and could save health services money through picking things up early,"" he says.
But as smartwatches become even more sophisticated, and manufacturers figure out more and more ways to obtain quantifiable data about the human body, the list of potential preventative health applications is only going to increase.
Masimo CEO Joe Kiani is already focusing on the next frontier for his company's smartwatches: being able to predict an asthma attack.
""We have a measurement for respiratory effort,"" says Kiani. ""We can tell when you're struggling to breathe because respiration rate increases, pulse rate increases… all trying to make up for the lack of oxygen that you're getting,"" he says. ""What's crazy is that for the past 50 to 60 years, all we've had at home is a thermometer to help you decide what to do [when you're sick]. Now we're going to have this rich set of information which can help people to stay out of the emergency department and still get the right care.""

29,"article,news",,The couple who took on Google and cost the tech giant £2bn,,"""Google essentially disappeared us from the internet.""Launch days. They’re equal parts thrilling and terrifying for many start-up business founders, but they don’t get much worse than the one Shivaun Raff and her husband, Adam, experienced.It was June 2006 and the couple’s trailblazing price comparison website Foundem - one they had sacrificed well-paid jobs for and built from scratch - had just gone fully live. They didn’t know it at the time but that day, and those that followed, would mark the beginning of the end for their company.
Foundem had been hit by a Google search penalty, prompted by one of the search engine’s automatic spam filters. It pushed the website way down the lists of search results for relevant queries like ""price comparison"" and ""comparison shopping"".It meant the couple’s website, which charged a fee when customers clicked on their product listings through to other websites, struggled to make any money.""We were monitoring our pages and how they were ranking, and then we saw them all plummet almost immediately, "" says Adam.While the launch day for Foundem didn't go to plan, it would lead to the start of something else – a 15-year legal battle that culminated in a then record €2.4bn (£2bn) fine for Google, which was deemed to have abused its market dominance. The case has been hailed as a landmark moment in the global regulation of Big Tech.Google spent seven years fighting that verdict, issued in June 2017, but in September this year Europe’s top court – the European Court of Justice – rejected its appeals.Speaking to Radio 4’s The Bottom Line in their first interview since that final verdict, Shivaun and Adam explained that at first, they thought their website’s faltering start had simply been a mistake.“We initially thought this was collateral damage, that we had been false positive detected as spam,” says Shivaun, 55. “We just assumed we had to escalate to the right place and it would be overturned.”""If you're denied traffic, then you have no business,"" adds Adam, 58.The couple sent Google numerous requests to have the restriction lifted but, more than two years later, nothing had changed and they said they received no response.Meanwhile, their website was ""ranking completely normally"" on other search engines, but that didn't really matter, according to Shivaun, as ""everyone's using Google"".The couple would later discover that their site was not the only one to have been put at a disadvantage by Google – by the time the tech giant was found guilty and fined in 2017 there were around 20 claimants, including Kelkoo, Trivago and Yelp.
Adam, who had built a career in supercomputing, says he had the ""eureka moment"" for Foundem while smoking a cigarette outside the offices of his previous employer.Then, price comparison websites were in their infancy, and each specialised in one particular product. But Foundem was different because it let customers compare a large range of products – from clothes to flights.“No-one else was anywhere close to this,” beams Shivaun, who herself had been a software consultant for several major global brands.In its 2017 judgement, the European Commission found that Google had illegally promoted its own comparison shopping service in search results, whilst demoting those of competitors.Ten years before that, though – when Foundem launched - Adam says he had no reason to assume Google was being deliberately anti-competitive over online shopping. ""They weren't really serious players,"" he says.But by the end of 2008, the couple had started to suspect foul play.It was three weeks before Christmas and the pair received a message warning that their website had suddenly become slow to load. They thought it was a cyber attack, ""but actually it was just that everyone had started visiting our website"", Adam laughs.Channel 5’s The Gadget Show had just named Foundem the best price comparison website in the UK.“And that was really important,” Shivaun explains, ""because we then reached out to Google and said, look, surely it's not benefiting your users to make it impossible for them to find us.“And that still got from Google, not a complete ignore, but a basically ‘bog off’.”""That was the moment we knew, OK, we need to fight,"" says Adam.
The couple went to the press, with limited success, and took their case to regulators in the UK, US, and Brussels.It was in the latter – with the European Commission (EC) – that the case eventually took off, with the launch of an antitrust investigation in November 2010. The couple’s first meeting with the regulators took place in a portable cabin in Brussels.“One of the things they said was if this is a systemic issue, why are you the first people we’re seeing?” Shivaun recalls. “We said we're not 100% sure, but we suspect people are afraid, because all businesses on the internet essentially rely on Google for the lifeblood that is their traffic.""
The couple were in a hotel room in Brussels, only a few hundred yards from the commission building, when competition commissioner Margarethe Vestager finally announced the verdict that they, and other shopping websites, had been waiting for.But there was no popping of champagne corks. Their focus then turned to making sure the EC enforced its decision.""I guess it was unfortunate for Google that they did it to us,"" Shivaun says. ""We've both been brought up maybe under the delusion that we can make a difference, and we really don't like bullies.""Even Google’s final defeat in the case last month did not spell the end for the couple.They believe Google’s conduct remains anti-competitive and the EC is looking into it. In March this year, under its new Digital Markets Act, the commission opened an investigation into Google’s parent company, Alphabet, over whether it continues to preference its own goods and services in search results.A spokesperson for Google said: “The CJEU [European Court of Justice] judgment [in 2024] only relates to how we showed product results from 2008-2017. ""The changes we made in 2017 to comply with the European Commission's Shopping decision have worked successfully for more than seven years, generating billions of clicks for more than 800 comparison shopping services.""For this reason, we continue to strongly contest the claims made by Foundem and will do so when the case is considered by the courts.""The Raffs are also pursuing a civil damages claim against Google, which is due to begin in the first half of 2026. But when, or if, a final victory comes for the couple it will likely be a Pyrrhic one - they were forced to close Foundem in 2016.The long fight against Google has been gruelling for them, too. ""I think if we had known it was going to be quite as many years as it turned out to be we might not have made the same choice,"" Adam admits.

30,"article,news",,Pikachus everywhere: Fans flock to UK's biggest gaming expo,Technology,"Thousands of comic and gaming fans headed to London on Saturday for one of the most colourful days in the UK’s convention calendar. Fans flocked to the ExCeL centre for the UK's largest gaming, comic and pop culture convention, many of them dressed in elaborate costumes they had constructed themselves. The event, called MCM X EGX, also brought together hundreds of actors, artists and video game publishers who gave fans a sneak peak at upcoming projects. It was the first time the annual video games show had been combined with MCM - which runs Comic Con - meaning guests were treated to a wider range of activities, including lightsaber battles, costume contests and card game sessions. 
Organisers told the BBC more than 100,000 people attended the show, travelling from across the UK and beyond. On the multiple stages dotted around the expo, fans formed long queues to hear from over 700 panellists who were speaking. The venue’s two halls were filled with displays, stalls and gameplay areas, with more than 450 exhibitors booking places to demonstrate products or sell merchandise. But none of those numbers can capture the energy, passion and excitement of comics and games enthusiasts at the event, on what many told the BBC was the greatest day of the year.“My favourite part is meeting other people who are cosplaying,” said Catherine Mariah as she travelled to the event on Saturday morning. “By the end of the day you’ll be sad it’s all over - you’ll have the 'con blues'!”
Gamers were given hands-on time with new releases including Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 - the latest instalment in the hugely popular first-person shooter series. Fans also got a preview of Avowed - an expansive fantasy role-playing game from US developer Obsidian, which is due for release in February next year. Smaller projects were also on display, like the gesture-controlled indie game Jazzhands, developed by two University of Nottingham students at a 24-hour programming competition.But despite strong fan interest in the video game side of the expo, the gaming industry has been struggling.Several big brands pulled out of this year's show after job cuts and an industry strike hit US development schedules.Organisers at MCM X EGX may have hoped that combining EGX with Comic Con would keep the video games expo alive, while getting a bigger audience for the publishers who stuck with them.

31,"article,news",,The clocks that take hours to wind back,,"When British Summer Time (BST) ends each year, the collections officer at a Victorian country house in Cornwall prepares herself for a busy day at work.At Lanhydrock, near Bodmin, which is run by the National Trust, the end of BST means Faye Rason has to wind 20 clocks back an hour - a process that can take two-and-a-half hours.Usually it takes her an hour-and-a-half each week to manually wind the clock collection, but turning them back takes longer, she said.One particularly challenging timepiece is a walnut long case clock made in 1740 because it chimes eight bells every 15 minutes - making putting it back a noisy affair.
Despite the clock's age, Ms Rason said it kept better time than any of the others.""It has three pendulums inside which are really heavy and because I'm quite short I have to go on tiptoes to wind each one,"" she said.""[But] its chime is beautiful, it sounds lovely.""Her favourite clock at Lanhydrock is a French eight-day striking clock but it, too, has its challenges.Ms Rason said: ""It has a glass dome so when I'm winding that one it always makes me really nervous because I have to remove it... the glass is so fragile. ""It sort of frays your nerves.""Every clock at the site has its own record sheet where each winding is noted, along with how many minutes slow or fast it is operating.This record helps the clock conservator to diagnose problems when they service the timepieces.

32,"article,news",,'I can't run a business like this': Why the WordPress row matters,Technology,"One of the world's biggest web publishing platforms - used by a large chunk of the internet - is locked in a spat which is affecting thousands of businesses worldwide.While most of the work WordPress does is not seen by internet users, it says its behind-the-scenes web-building tools power 40% of the world's websites.That means its disagreement with a company called WP Engine is causing disruption to the huge number businesses that rely on the two organisations to keep their websites running.Tricia Fox, who runs an agency that manages about 70 websites - and is caught up in the row - told the BBC: ""I can't run a business on this level of uncertainty.""The very wide use of WordPress makes it ""crucial to the internet"", according to Daniel Card, fellow of BCS, the Chartered Institute for IT.But that also means ""its actions definitely have a big ripple effect online"", he says - a ripple effect firms like Tricia Fox's are starting to really feel.
The row between the companies begins with the fact that WordPress has two sides: its non-profit organisation (the WordPress Foundation), and its profit-making arm (called Automattic). WordPress makes its source code open, which mean anyone can use it to create and redistribute their own tools for free.That's what WP Engine does to run a web hosting service.But in return for the source code, WordPress' boss, Matt Mullenweg, expects those who use it to contribute to its maintenance - for example by fixing bugs and testing new features.Mr Mullenweg accuses WP Engine of failing to do so, going so far as to call it ""a cancer to WordPress.""As a result, in late September, he banned WP Engine from using key parts of WordPress.WP Engine rejects these claims.""We are proud of our extensive contributions to the WordPress ecosystem,"" WP Engine wrote in a post on X/Twitter.
Caught in the middle of this row are the countless websites and blogs that rely on the two companies' services.People like Tricia Fox, who uses a WP Engine subsidiary to host the websites her company serves.She now says she is ""almost certain"" to migrate her websites to a different host - a decision which she says is worth ""tens of thousands of pounds"" over the next few years.She wants to move away from WP Engine because the fallout has resulted in dozens of hours of extra work for her staff - increasing costs for her business.""The team don't know if it's going to work today or not,"" Ms Fox told the BBC.But she worries even a costly move away from WP Engine may not solve her problems, as she would still be using another host based on the WordPress code.""What's to stop WordPress from doing this again [to another company]?"" she asks.""Right now we are currently focused on resolving our dispute with WP Engine,"" Automattic said when the BBC asked if it would go after other companies in a similar manner.
The row also underscores how important the open source principle is to the online economy.While big tech might attract the headlines, for many people and businesses it is something much less eye-catching that keeps them afloat.""Open source is all about sharing code and standards so everyone benefits, and it’s a huge part of what makes the internet work,"" says Daniel Card.And with WordPress being such a big player in that world, if it makes changes to its tools, he adds, ""it’s felt by users everywhere and often impacts hosting, plugins, and web standards across the internet.""
While much of the spat between the two sides has taken place through official social media accounts and blog posts, it has also entered the courtroom.WordPress cannot force WP Engine to contribute to its open source project - but it does have control over its trademarks.It argues that WP Engine mentions WordPress in its marketing tools to help sell its product - and therefore should pay to use the trademark.""Any business making hundreds of millions of dollars off of an open source project ought to give back, and if they don't, then they can’t use its trademarks,"" Mr Mullenweg wrote in a blog post.The trademarks do not cover the ""WP"" abbreviation, but the WordPress Foundation says: ""please don’t use it in a way that confuses people"".WP Engine has meanwhile filed a legal case against Mr Mullenweg and Automattic, with accusations of attempted extortion, libel and a violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act among its complaints.It claims Automattic told WP Engine they would have to pay ""tens of millions of dollars"" in order to continue using the WordPress trademarks.WP Engine has since asked for the legal process to be sped up as its businesses are suffering.Its recent filing claimed the number of cancellation requests it receives have increased by 14% compared to normal trading, as a result of the disruption.It said it it is also losing out on potential new customers due to uncertainty over its future access to WordPress products.Automattic has called the lawsuit ""baseless"" and ""flawed, start to finish."" ""We vehemently deny WP Engine’s allegations - which are gross mischaracterizations of reality,"" it said in a statement, adding that it would ""vigorously litigate against this absurd filing"".

33,"article,news",,Microsoft boss gets 63% pay rise despite asking for reduction,Technology,"Microsoft's chief executive Satya Nadella earned $79.1m (£61m) last year, a rise of 63% compared to his compensation the year before.That was despite a request from Mr Nadella to reduce one element of his pay package because of cybersecurity flaws at the tech giant  - which resulted in him getting $5m less than he otherwise would have.In common with many tech firms, Microsoft has cut thousands of jobs this year, including many in its gaming division.But in a proxy statement filed with the US financial regulator, the board said the company's revenue grew by 16% in the year to 30 June 2024.
""Mr. Nadella agreed that the Company’s performance was extremely strong,"" Microsoft's compensation committee wrote in a letter to shareholders.It added he asked them ""to consider departing from the established performance metrics and reduce his cash incentive to reflect his personal accountability"" over a number of cyber attacks.One such attack was reported in July 2023 by Microsoft, where hackers gained access to the email accounts of around 25 organisations, including government agencies.Microsoft said the attack originated in China, though the Chinese embassy in London called this ""disinformation"".The fiscal period runs up to 30 June 2024 - just weeks before the massive internet outage which affected Microsoft Windows PCs, causing chaos around the world.While that was not a cyber attack, later in July Microsoft apologised for another outage which was caused by a cyber attack.
The compensation committee said it reduced Mr Nadella's cash pay by more than half, to $5.2m.That represents less than 7% of his total pay.The bulk of his pay, $71.2m, was made up of stock options.High Pay Centre director Luke Hildyard said ""superficially"" the earnings made sense given Microsoft's strong financial performance.""However, we might also ask whether the extra $79 million on top of $49 million last year for someone who is already worth hundreds of millions, with more money than they could spent over multiple lifetimes of absolute luxury, is really necessary as a reward of incentive,"" he told the BBC.""None of Microsoft's success would be possible without workers, customers and wider society so perhaps the proceeds of that success should be share a little more evenly,"" he added.Elsewhere in big tech, Apple boss Tim Cook earned $63.2m in 2023, while the chief executive of the world's most valuable company Nvidia, Jensen Huang, was paid $34.2m in the 2024 fiscal year.But none of them come close to Tesla boss Elon Musk, whose pay packet could be worth up to $56bn.

34,"article,news",,UK regulator: Clear link between online posts and violent disorder ,Technology,"There was a ""clear connection"" between the violent disorder in England and Northern Ireland in the summer and posts on social media and messaging apps, Ofcom has concluded.The government had asked the media regulator to consider how illegal content and disinformation spread during the unrest.In an open letter setting out its findings, Ofcom boss Dame Melanie Dawes said such content spread ""widely and quickly"" online following the stabbings in Southport, in July, which preceded the disorder.She added most online services took ""rapid action"", but said the responses of some firms were ""uneven"".""Posts about the Southport incident and subsequent events from high-profile accounts reached millions of users, demonstrating the role that virality and algorithmic recommendations can play in driving divisive narratives in a crisis period,"" Dame Melanie wrote.The BBC approached major tech platforms for their response to the letter.X, formerly Twitter, told BBC News some accounts were suspended and other content was removed from the platform following the riots.A spokesman from the messaging app Telegram said they ""immediately removed UK channels that called for violence as they were discovered in August"".None of the other major tech platforms responded to the BBC's request for comment.Experts say the unrest showed the power - and responsibility - social media platforms have.""Ofcom is saying that social media posts inciting riots are not just words - they play a big part in fanning the flames of disorder,"" said Rashik Parmar, from BCS, the Chartered Institute for IT.""There should be accountability where platforms allow dangerously divisive content to go unchecked,"" he added.Media analyst Hanna Kahlert, at Midia Research, said Ofcom's findings amounted to a ""call for social platforms to take greater ownership of the impact of content"".
At the time of the unrest, Ofcom faced criticism for not doing more to rein in the spread of untrue and inflammatory content.It urged tech firms to take action - but also pointed out the enhanced powers it is due to get under the Online Safety Act had not yet come into force.The act will see the creation of codes of practice for big tech firms which will place new responsibilities on them for tackling disinformation.""I am confident that, had the draft codes been in force at the time, they would have provided a firm basis for urgent engagement with services on the steps they were taking to protect UK users from harm,"" Dame Melanie wrote.She said the new powers set ""clear standards"" for what Ofcom would expect to see in future from big tech firms, such as:Specifying in their terms of service provisions how individuals are to be protected from priority illegal contentHaving systems designed to swiftly take down illegal content and having ""adequately resourced"" content moderation teams Providing effective and accessible mechanisms for users to complain about illegal content, including on messaging platforms
The unrest which broke out in August this year was the worst that had been seen in the UK for a decade.It was followed by waves of arrests and prosecutions, some for online offences. The role that big tech played was subject to much scrutiny - though the platforms themselves remained largely silent at the time.The prime minister also got dragged into a war of words with one of the highest profile people in tech - X owner Elon Musk.The tech billionaire suggested that ""civil war is inevitable"" following the disorder.Sir Keir Starmer hit back saying there was ""no justification"" for Mr Musk's comments, adding there was more that social media companies ""can and should be doing"".A spokesman from X told the BBC: ""X monitored the platform and actioned thousands of pieces of content as part of our internal incident response protocols.""The X spokesman said some accounts were suspended and other content was removed, but they didn’t specify any more details.The spokesman also highlighted the role of community notes. He said this ""played an important role in addressing misleading content across the platform in relation to the incidents and these have been viewed millions of times"".

35,"article,news",,US warns Musk political group that $1m voter giveaway may be illegal,Technology,"A letter sent to Elon Musk's political action committee from the US Department of Justice (DOJ) warned that his lottery-style giveaway of $1m per day to a registered voter may be illegal, according to US media. Mr Musk, who is the world's richest man, actively campaigns for Republican Donald Trump in his presidential bid against Kamala Harris. Over the weekend, the owner of Tesla and X/Twitter began giving away prizes to American voters who signed a petition. It's unclear when the DOJ letter was sent to Mr Musk's organisation, America PAC. DOJ investigators have declined to comment on the case.
US outlets, including CBS News, the BBC's US partner, reported on Wednesday that the letter informed Musk's team that the giveaway may violate federal election laws. It was sent by the DOJ's Public Integrity Section following outrage from Democrats over the cash stunt. Election polls - is Harris or Trump ahead?Under US law, it is illegal to pay people to register to vote. But it remains unclear whether the sweepstakes breaks any laws. Mr Musk's contest offers money to signatories of a petition, which the PAC circulated. “We want to try to get over a million, maybe 2 million voters in the battleground states to sign the petition in support of the First and Second Amendment,” Mr Musk said in Pennsylvania on Saturday when he announced the event. The contest rules state that winners must be registered to vote, but no party affiliation is required. “We are going to be awarding $1 million (£770,000) randomly to people who have signed the petition, every day, from now until the election,” he said.The America PAC website states the goal is getting “1 million registered voters in swing states to sign in support of the Constitution, especially freedom of speech and the right to bear arms”.It is open to voters in seven swing states - Pennsylvania, Georgia, Nevada, Arizona, Michigan, Wisconsin and North Carolina. US election day is 5 November.
On Tuesday, a group of Republican ex-prosecutors wrote to the DOJ urging officials to investigate the contest. ""We are aware of nothing like this in modern political history,"" they wrote, pointing to potential federal and state law violations.""Law enforcement agencies are appropriately reluctant to take action shortly before elections that could affect how people vote. But serious questions arising under laws that directly regulate the voting process must be an exception.""Mr Musk previously dismissed claims that the contest is illegal, saying: ""You can be from any or no political party, and you don’t even have to vote.""On Sunday, the contest reframed its rules, describing the money as payment for a job, according to CNN.America PAC said the winner will be “selected to earn $1M as a spokesperson for America PAC”. Winners have gone on to film pro-Trump videos. 
Several legal experts have told the BBC that they believe the contest may be illegal.""His offer is only open to registered voters, so I think his offer runs afoul of this provision,"" said Paul Schiff Berman, a law professor at the George Washington University.He pointed to the US Code on electoral law, which states that anyone who ""pays or offers to pay or accepts payment either for registration to vote or for voting"" faces a potential $10,000 fine or a five-year prison sentence.Adav Noti of the non-partisan Campaign Legal Center said Mr Musk's scheme ""violates federal law and is subject to civil or criminal enforcement by the Department of Justice"".""It is illegal to give out money on the condition that recipients register as voters,"" Mr Noti told the BBC.But Jeremy Paul, who teaches law at Northeastern University, said that Mr Musk may have found a legal loophole.He said that, while there is an argument that the offer could be illegal, it is “targeted and designed to get around what’s supposed to be the law"" and he believes the case would be difficult to make in court.

36,"article,news",,Trump has the world’s richest man on his side. What does Musk want?,Technology,"Zander Mundy was midway through a typical day at his office when he heard the news: tech billionaire Elon Musk was speaking at a nearby school in the town of Folsom, in the US state of Pennsylvania. ""When is the richest guy in the world in town often?"" Mr Mundy remembers thinking to himself. With a population of just under 9,000 people, Folsom is a quiet place. Residents typically shy away from speaking openly about their politics, and political yard signs are few and far between. The 21-year-old Mr Mundy, who works at a leasing agent at an apartment complex, admits that he wasn't planning on voting in the November election. But once he saw crowds forming - and felt the excitement - he decided to go in, eager to hear from Musk. By the time he left the school, he recalls leaning more towards Donald Trump than towards Kamala Harris. ""[If] someone like that tells you this is the election that's going to decide our future, not only who's president for the next four years but what the world world is going to be like... I think that's pretty huge,"" he told the BBC. ""That matters. That's significant."" Musk, who previously cultivated an image as an eccentric tech genius who was only on the sidelines of politics, has now pledged full allegiance to Trump. In full view of the American public, the 53-year-old has invested his time, operational know-how and ample pocketbook into trying to get the Republican elected - a rarity among the nation's business elite who traditionally prefer to influence politics from behind the scenes.It's an approach that is starkly different to traditional CEOs, many of whom have been better known for holding expensive, exclusive fundraising dinners or hosting potential donors at lavish homes in the Hamptons. And it's prompted observers to ask questions about Mr Musk's motivations.Follow live updates from the US campaign trailElection polls - is Harris or Trump ahead?The traditional approach by CEOs is ""not out in the public spotlight,"" explains Erik Gordon, chair of the entrepreneurship department at the University of Michigan's Ross School of Business. But ""Musk does it loudly and proudly, and, therefore, perhaps makes himself a lightning rod"". Musk's Trump-supporting political action committee - America PAC - has already spent more than $119m (£91.6m) this election cycle, according to Open Secrets, a non-profit tracker. Additionally, Musk's own contributions make him one of the largest individual donors in the presidential race, and reportedly play a vital role in Trump's door-knocking and ground operation in key swing states in which the campaign hopes to mobilise voters. Steve Davis, a key lieutenant of Musk's who has worked for his companies including SpaceX, X and the Boring Company, has reportedly been recruited to help in the effort. 
Mr Musk's personal investment into the campaign is something that was quickly noticed by Mr Mundy. ""That alone was shocking to me,"" he said. ""That someone would really spend that much time and money to influence voters. That means he's doing it for a reason."" Some Democrats, like Pennsylvania Senator John Fetterman, have been urging their party to not ignore the threat Mr Musk poses ahead of the election. Mr Musk appeals to a demographic of people who see him as ""undeniably brilliant"" and among whom traditional Democratic outreach efforts have proven difficult, Fetterman believes. Why Trump is courting old friends from the WWEAre Elon Musk's election giveaways legal?Since first endorsing Trump in the wake of the assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania, on 13 July, Mr Musk has become a common fixture on the campaign trail, where he often delivers warnings that only Trump can ""save"" American democracy. In the closing days of the race, Mr Musk has criss-crossed the state of Pennsylvania, a key battleground state that has become a focus for Trump and Kamala Harris alike. America PAC is now doling out $1m a day until election day to one random voter - no matter their party affiliation - provided they have registered to vote and sign a petition. At ""town hall"" events in Harrisburg and Pittsburgh over the weekend, for example, Mr Musk presented giant lottery-style cheques to winners, with enthusiastic crowds chanting ""Elon"". He responded by telling the crowd that their energy ""lights a fire"" in his soul.At a rally in Philadelphia on Monday, Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said Mr Musk was “dangling a million bucks to many of us who are struggling to make ends meet, if they dance for him"".“Elon Musk thinks that dangling money in front of a working person is a cute thing to do when the election of our lives is before us because that’s what people and billionaires like that do,"" she added.Some observers, however, have questioned his motivation and have suggested that Mr Musk and his businesses stand to benefit from a relationship with Trump. Among those observers is Matt Teske, the CEO of electric vehicle charging platform Chargeway. According to Mr Teske, Mr Musk's political shift has been difficult for many in the electric vehicle industry, but comes as no surprise after several years of becoming increasingly active in politics. ""I think Musk's interests are focused, predominantly, around a handful of things that are important to him related to his businesses, [with] regulation being something he's voiced concerns around,"" Mr Teske says. He notes that Mr Musk ""pushed back heavily"" on restrictions implemented during the Covid-19 pandemic in California. 
The University of Michigan's Professor Gordon agrees. He says Mr Musk sees himself as a someone who has been held back by regulators, and feels that government intervention has stifled the development of the technologies he is focused on, such as autonomous driving. ""He wants to be sort of on the frontier, [a] wild and woolly entrepreneur who can break new paths and not be bogged down by regulation, which tends to fall five, 10, 20 years behind advances in technology,"" Prof Gordon says. ""Musk wants to go the other way,"" he adds. ""He wants to go to Mars.""If he wins in November, Donald Trump has suggested that Mr Musk could oversee ""cost cutting"" in the US government. Even if he doesn't do that exact job, Mr Musk would have Trump's ear thanks to his support during the campaign, observers believe, and he could have a strong influence on the administration's decision-making. Mr Musk, for his part, has said he would be open to the idea of leading a ""department of government efficiency"" to end regulation's ""strangulation"" of the US. That position, Democrats say, could present a complex conflict of interest, given the billions in government contracts Mr Musk has received for SpaceX and Tesla. ""That's kind of deeply both unethical and illegal,"" says Lenny Mendonca, California Governor Gavin Newsom's former chief economic and business adviser. Mendonca believes that those with intertwined government and regulatory relationships ""can have a voice"" but should not be in a position of authority over those same interests. Lawrence Noble, a former general counsel at the Federal Election Commission, has questioned the legality of Mr Musk's giveaways in the election cycle. Mr Noble believes that this form of campaigning should concern Americans who value safe work environments and consumer protections. “We know what companies do when left to their own devices. They put profit and stockholder value and CEO compensation above safety, and they kind of write off the safety issues as a cost of doing business,” he tells the BBC. ""It's dangerous to have somebody who views business that way, and views government that way, in charge of safety,"" he adds. For Mr Musk -  who relishes being a ""disrupter"" and renegade - there's little question that his lucrative relationships with the US government will continue, no matter the result of the November election. But his brand, and his reputation, are now tied to Donald Trump's - and his actions suggest he knows it. Additional reporting by Pratiksha Ghildial

37,"article,news",,Facebook and Instagram launch celebrity scam ad crackdown,Technology,"Facebook and Instagram owner Meta is to introduce facial recognition technology to try and crack down on scammers who fraudulently use celebrities in adverts.Elon Musk and personal finance expert, Martin Lewis, are among those to fall victim to such scams, which typically promote investment schemes and crypto-currencies.Mr Lewis previously told the Today programme, on BBC Radio 4, that he receives ""countless"" reports of his name and face being used in such scams every day, and had been left feeling ""sick"" by them.Meta already uses an ad review system which uses artificial intelligence (AI) to detect fake celebrity endorsements but is now seeking to beef it up with facial recognition tech.It will work by comparing images from ads flagged as being dubious with celebrities' Facebook or Instagram profile photos.If the image is a confirmed to be a match, and the ad a scam, it will be automatically deleted.Meta said ""early testing"" of the system had shown ""promising results"" so it would now start showing in-app notifications to a larger group of public figures who had been impacted by so-called ""celeb-bait.""
The problem of celebrity scams has been a long-running one for Meta.It became so significant in the 2010s that Mr Lewis took legal action against Facebook, but he ultimately dropped the case when the tech giant agreed to introduce a button so people could report scam ads. In addition to introducing the button, Facebook also agreed to donate £3m to Citizens Advice.But, since then, the scams have become more complex and significantly more believable.They are increasingly powered by so-called deepfake technology, where a realistic computer-generated likeness or video is used to make it seem like the celebrity is backing a product or service.Meta has faced pressure to do something about the growing threat of these ads.On Sunday, Mr Lewis urged the government to give the UK regulator, Ofcom, more powers to tackle scam ads after a fake interview with Chancellor Rachel Reeves was used to trick people into giving away their bank details.""Scammers are relentless and continuously evolve their tactics to try to evade detection,"" Meta acknowledged.""We hope that by sharing our approach, we can help inform our industry’s defences against online scammers,"" it added.
Meta has also announced it will also use facial recognition tech to help people who find themselves locked out of their social media.Currently, unlocking Instagram or Facebook accounts involves uploading official ID or documents.But now video selfies and face recognition is being tested as a way to prove who a person is and and regain access more quickly.The material provided by the user will be checked against the account's profile image to see if it is a match.However, the widespread use of facial recognition is controversial - Facebook has previously used it, before ditching it in 2021 over privacy, accuracy and bias concerns.It now says that the video selfies will be encrypted and stored securely, and won't be shown publicly. Facial data generated in making the comparison will be deleted after the check.But the system will not be initially offered in areas where permission from regulators has not yet been obtained, including the UK and EU.

38,"article,features",,The AI art redefining creativity,Future,"Artificial intelligence is being used to generate paintings, images and even sculptures, with some selling for thousands of dollars. Do we need to reframe our definition of art?
In the drawing room of a stately home in rural Oxfordshire, I watch on as a dungaree-clad artist slowly and deliberately puts pen to paper. Her arm moves across the canvas, the marks gradually coalescing into an abstract portrait of herself.
It seems like a moment of creative expression. But this is no ordinary artist – she is the world's first humanoid robot artist, Ai-Da. By design, her very existence brings into question how we define art, and who, or in this case, what, can create it.
Will AI algorithms and robots like Ai-Da spell the end of human creativity and artistry, or can they be harnessed to augment our own creative potential?
Art in flux
When Marcel Duchamp proposed that a porcelain urinal be considered art and submitted it for exhibition in early 20th-Century New York, he flipped the art world on its head. He argued that anything could be considered as art, if chosen by the artist and labelled as such. It was a profoundly revolutionary thought which challenged previous notions of art as beautiful, technically skilful and emotive.
In much the same way, AI-created artworks are disrupting the accepted norms of the art world. As philosopher Alice Helliwell from Northeastern University London argues, if we can consider radical and divergent pieces like Duchamp's urinal and Tracey Emin's bed as art proper, how can something created by a generative algorithm be dismissed? After all, both were controversial at the time and contain objects that haven't technically been created by an ""artist's"" hand.
""Historically, the way we understand the definition of art has shifted,"" says Heliwell. ""It is hard to see why a urinal can be art, but art made by a generative algorithm could not be.""
Throughout history, every radical artistic movement has been intimately connected to the cultural zeitgeist of the time, a reflection of society's preoccupations and concerns, like Turner and his industrial landscapes and Da Vinci's obsession with science and mathematics. AI is no different. Ai-Da's creators, gallerist Aidan Meller and researcher Lucy Seal cite this as a pivotal reason for the existence of a humanoid artist like Ai-Da. She is the personification of one of contemporary society's current fears, the rise of job-snatching AI algorithms and potential robot domination.
But technological revolutions like artificial intelligence need not signify the ""end of art"" as many fear. Instead, they can help to kickstart an artistic metamorphosis and move us towards totally different ways of seeing and creating, something Marcus du Sautoy, a mathematician at the University of Oxford and author of The Creativity Code: Art and Innovation in the Age of AI, would contend.
Humans are just as prone to behaving like machines, repeating old behaviours and getting bogged down with rules, like a painter or musician locked into a particular style. ""AI might help us to stop behaving like machines…and kick us into being creative again as humans,"" says du Sautoy. He sees it as a powerful collaborator in the pursuit of human creativity.
There is historical precedence for new technology liberating us from our creative shackles. Take the invention of photography in the 1800s for example. Some artists saw the camera as the antithesis of an artist, and photographs as the mortal enemy of the art establishment.
But instead of replacing painting, photography became a catalyst in the development of the experimental modern art movement of the 20th Century, as artists moved away from realism towards abstraction, a shift that paved the way for the contemporary art of today.
Who's the artist?
Walking around Ai-Da's country pile in Oxfordshire I got to appreciate the sheer breadth of her artworks to-date. Unsettling busts of herself with her eyes stapled shut, scarab beetles fused to her face; partial and ethereal depictions of computer scientist Alan Turing; and colourful pop-art inspired portraits of Glastonbury headliners. 
Unlike the numerous text-to-image generators like Dall-E and Midjourney that have the ability to create alarmingly plausible magazine front covers and win coveted art competitions, Ai-Da's artistic process doesn't rely solely upon the data on which she has been trained. (Find out more about AI training in this simple guide to machine learning.)
Ai-Da also makes use of the cameras in her eyes, which feed novel images into her algorithm, thereby creating new and unique works far removed from human-generated datasets. This is how she's able to create self-portraiture. Does this make her creative in her own right? And can we credit her with authorship, or does this reside with the artists upon whose work she's been trained and with the creators of her algorithm, who ultimately wrote her code?
Margaret Boden, a researcher in cognitive science at the University of Sussex in the UK, has developed one of the most widely accepted definitions of creativity to date. She sees it as the ability to generate ideas that are new, valuable and surprising. Using this definition, the works produced by machines like Ai-Da could be considered creative, argue her creators. Whether or not an algorithm or a robot itself can be described as a creative entity, an 'artist' in its own right, like a human, remains up for debate, and this in part comes down to authorship. 
Questions of authorship and data ownership plague the artificial intelligence narrative. Artists Holly Herndon and Mat Dryhurst, who recently held an exhibition exploring collaborative artwork in the age of AI at London's Serpentine Gallery, want to confront the issue of data misuse and authorship in AI. The pair co-founded Spawning AI, a suite of tools aimed at empowering human creators to both prohibit AI from using their works and to find whether works of theirs have already been referenced in AI generated work.
Plagiarism is a legitimate concern for many artists as their work is used to train algorithms but also can then be copied in the works that generative AI tools produce.
But there are also artists who see AI as a new outlet for their own creativity – a fresh medium they can wield much like a brush or palette knife. Some artists, such as Sougwen Chung, are now exclusively training algorithms on their works alone in an attempt to push their own creative boundaries.
There is another argument at the heart of this issue too. The machine-learning processes used to train generative AI algorithms may be a creative process in themselves.
""Code exposed to data – existing artworks, for example – is able to learn, mutate and evolve,"" says du Sautoy. ""It means that the code by the end of this learning process is very different from the original code written by the human. This means that there is a chance for the code to produce something that... deserves to be called the creativity of the code rather than the human who started the process.
""It's a bit like Picasso is made from the DNA of his parents but it is his learning and exposure to the world that resulted in his creativity. You would never credit that to the parents even though everything started with their code or DNA."" (Learn more about machine learning and some of the other terms you need to understand AI better.)
Powerful algorithms called Creative Adversarial Networks (Cans) also now exist, designed to deliberately create something that goes against the patterns in the training data, breaking with the style of the art upon which it's been trained. This is leading to AIs that generate very surprising results. ""Many machine learning algorithms are 'black boxes',"" says Helliwell. ""We do not fully know what is happening inside the system, even if we have designed it ourselves.""
This is a common and unsettling problem throughout the AI world. How can we trust the decisions or outputs from an AI if we don't understand how it got there in the first place? (Read more about why humans may never understand AI.)
Is art uniquely human?
The prospect of truly artistic machines is also challenging another long-held belief about what makes us human. Art has long been seen as a uniquely human endeavour. Made by humans, for aesthetic appreciation by other humans, artworks themselves are imbued with the emotions of their creators. It is a visual representation of their desires and fears, frustrations and reverence, or at the very least their need to create for practical, economical and emotional reasons.
So, can we consider the creations of non-human entities to be art by the same definition? There are some who believe that animals already produce forms of art. And research has shown that pigeons seem to be able to discriminate between different types of artwork.
It all comes down to intent, this is ""what truly distinguishes the creativity of the human and the machine"", says du Sautoy. ""No machine is driven to express itself creatively. It is prompted by the intention of the human.""
Does this mean AI is not yet fully capable of creating true art? After all, computer algorithms lack any real-world experience and robots like Ai-Da, although capable of self-portraiture, don't actually possess self-awareness. This question remains hotly contested. For Helliwell a lack of intent shouldn't necessarily preclude AI works from being considered art.
More like this:
And perhaps that is what it comes down to. Art, goes the idiom, is in the eye of the beholder. As humans, for example, we identify patterns and admire the artistry evident in the natural world – the intricate web of a spider, the decorative plumage of a peacock. We often refer to bird calls as music and the mating displays of some animals as dance. There are numerous examples of animals exhibiting creative behaviours that we might label artistic. The Bower bird and pufferfish play with perspective, symmetry and colour in much the same way a human artist might, for example. And while these animals may not necessarily be intentionally creating these to be enjoyed as works of art, their actions are no less intentional in their pursuit of attracting a mate or warding off competitors.
What's the future?
However we look to define art or the artist, it's clear that AI algorithms and machines like Ai-Da are having an impact on the art world. Their works are exhibited alongside more traditional forms of art in established art institutions worldwide. Next year we'll see the world's first AI art gallery open its doors in LA, a permanent exhibition space for ""ethical AI"".
Eva Jäger, the creative AI lead and arts technologies curator at the Serpentine Gallery in London, is also helping to bring AI art to the masses, with a programme of exhibitions provoking critical discussion about the impact of technology on art.
For her, the future of AI art is not adversarial. Traditional forms of art will continue to exist, just as AI artwork will continue to develop. She sees the collaboration between human and machine as a space for real creative potential. She believes that the artist's intent and the human practice behind a piece or installation which utilises technology like AI are more important than just the final aesthetics.
""For me there are some really interesting generative images that get produced, but without the practice behind it I'm not sold on them, just because they're an amazing image,"" she says. ""And I would say the same about painting. I’m much more interested in the systems, including the humans behind the work. I want to know what they are using the system for, what are they exploring? It's a mistake just to look at the final artefact.""
And when it comes to evaluating the authenticity and credibility of AI art, one of the most contentious aspects of the AI art discipline, du Sautoy makes a compelling point. All art is a product of that which came before it, and creativity cannot come from nothing – all artists whether human, robot or algorithm, build upon the works of others.
""Too many people discuss creativity as if it is some uniquely human magical process, that it conjures something from nothing like a magician,"" says du Sautoy. ""But that is just because we don't understand our own creativity.""

39,"article,features",,How barcodes took over the world,Future,"Few people think twice about the barcodes on their shopping, but in the 75 years since they were first dreamed up, they have helped save lives, gone into space and stoked fears of the Antichrist.
Lasers. That's what supermarket staff need, insisted Paul McEnroe. Scanners in the checkout and little pistol-shaped laser guns, too. Point, shoot, sell!
In 1969, it was an outlandish vision of the future: these lasers would scan weird little black-and-white markings on products that McEnroe and his colleagues at IBM had designed. It would speed up supermarket queues, he enthused. The solution would come to be known as the barcode.
At this point in history barcodes had never been used commercially – though the idea had been brewing for decades following a patent filed on 20 October 1949 by one of the engineers who was now part of McEnroe's team. The IBM engineers were trying to bring barcodes to life. They had a vision of the future where shoppers whizzed through the checkout with lasers scanning every item they wanted to purchase. But IBM's lawyers had a problem with the future.
""No way,"" they said, according to McEnroe, a now-retired engineer. Their fear was ""laser suicide"". What if people intentionally injured their eyes with the scanners and then sued IBM? What if supermarket staff went blind?
No, no, this was a mere half-milliwatt laser beam, McEnroe tried to explain. There was 12,000 times more energy in a 60-watt lightbulb. His pleas fell flat. And so he turned to Rhesus monkeys imported from Africa, though now he can't remember how many. ""I think it was six,"" he says. ""I couldn't swear to that."" After tests at a nearby laboratory proved that exposure to the tiny laser did not harm the animals' eyes, the lawyers relented.
And that is how the scanning of barcodes became commonplace in supermarkets across the US, and ultimately the entire world.
In an unexpected twist, the laboratory used by McEnroe subsequently told him it would be sending him the monkeys. They were his problem now. ""It was crazy,"" he recalls, laughing. ""I found a zoo in North Carolina.""
Alongside the monkeys, each human member of McEnroe's team at IBM also deserves credit for the Universal Product Code (UPC), as their version of the barcode became formally known. Among their number was Joe Woodland, the engineer who dreamed up the early concept behind barcodes decades earlier, after drawing lines in the sand on a beach. It was he and another engineer who made the application to patent the fundamental idea for barcodes back in October 1949.
Crucially, George Laurer and other members of the IBM team then took this pre-existing proposal for barcode-style markings and developed them into a neat rectangle of black, vertical lines corresponding to a number that could uniquely identify any supermarket item imaginable. From tins of soup to boxes of cereal or packets of spaghetti. The grocery industry formally adopted the UPC in 1973 and the first product bearing one was scanned at Marsh Supermarket in Ohio in 1974. From there, it conquered the planet.
Other kinds of barcode soon followed and the UPC also laid the foundations for so-called ""2D barcodes"" such as QR codes, which can encode even more information. But the history of these little black-and-white markings is far wilder and rockier than you would ever imagine.
You could even argue that it began with the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).
""I was scanning things for the CIA,"" explains McEnroe. ""Great big maps."" That was one of his first jobs at IBM, involving image scanners. As he explains in his book about the invention of the UPC barcode, this helped to prepare him for working on completely new, but related, technology that would revolutionise the retail industry.
McEnroe knew that checkout lines in stores would move much more quickly if staff could just scan products into a computer rather than having to read the prices stamped on each item and then manually process the sale. To be accepted, such a code-scanning system would have to work pretty much every time – and read the code correctly even if the product was pulled across the scanner at speeds of up to 100 inches per second (2.5m/s).
The IBM team set to work, drawing on the design patented by Woodland and his colleague – however, with an important difference. The original approach relied on reading the thickness of the black lines. One of the concepts they had proposed in the patent – a round, bulls-eye style barcode formed of concentric circles – had even been developed by a competing group. But this had proven difficult to print and even harder to fit neatly onto product packaging.
The IBM team worked out that it was easier to print vertical lines and base the scanning process not on measuring the thickness of those lines but rather the distance between the leading edge of one line and the leading edge of the line next to it. In other words, the space between the lines, which was more reflective and easier to pick up by the scanner. That way, it didn't matter if the label printer had too much ink and drew lines that were thicker than intended – the scan would still work, pretty much every time.
While the first barcode-branded product was sold in a US supermarket in 1974, it took another five years for barcodes to reach British supermarkets. As soon as they did, the first item to be scanned there was a box of teabags.
McEnroe stresses that the launch of UPC barcode technology was not without controversy. ""Our first store didn't open,"" he recalls. There were people outside protesting the fact that prices would no longer be stamped on every product, merely on the shelves where products were placed in-store.
Some labour unions at the time felt – ultimately, correctly – that scanning technology threatened certain supermarket jobs. There were also concerns that barcodes could be used to obfuscate prices. McEnroe himself remembers how, in the past, shoppers sometimes searched for aging items in a supermarket since those ones might still have an older, lower price stamped on them. If barcodes took over, opportunities for such bargain-hunting would disappear.
These worries soon fizzled out. But barcodes have always upset some people.
To a fanatical few, they are nothing short of evil. In 2023, Jordan Frith, a professor of communication at Clemson University in South Carolina, published a book about the history of barcodes. During his research, he found a 1975 article in a publication called Gospel Call that suggested barcodes could be ""the Mark of the Beast"" – a reference to a biblical prophecy from the Book of Revelation about the end of the world. The New Testament passage in question refers to a beast – sometimes interpreted as the Antichrist – that forces every person to be marked on their right hand or forehead. In the prophecy, only those who accept such a mark are allowed to buy or sell.
The 1975 article suggested that, eventually, barcodes would be ""laser tattooed"" onto everybody's forehead or the back of their hand, ready for presentation at supermarket checkouts. 
Although bizarre, the idea has proved surprisingly sticky. A 1982 book called The New Money System by evangelical writer Mary Stewart Relfe further popularised the supposed connection between UPC barcodes and the Mark of the Beast after she claimed the number 666 was ""hidden"" within the lines at either end and the middle of each barcode.
In fact, these ""guard lines"", as they are known, serve as a reference point to help the laser scanner pick out the start and end of each UPC sequence. Laurer in the IBM team, considered co-inventor of the UPC, later insisted there was nothing sinister about this and the resemblance to the pattern used to encode the number six was a coincidence.
But the bizarre theory can still be found in certain corners of the Internet. And some even take extreme steps to avoid barcodes, including members of an orthodox Russian Christian group known as Old Believers. One such Old Believer, Agafia Lykov, who lives in an especially remote part of Siberia, told visiting journalists from Vice in 2013 that barcodes were ""the stamp of the Antichrist"". She added that if anyone gives her something, such as a packet of seeds, with a barcode on it, she takes the contents out and burns the packet.
Plus, in 2014, a Russian dairy company posted a statement on its website explaining why there was a red cross printed over the barcodes on its cartons of milk. Because, as is ""well known"", the statement read, barcodes are the Mark of the Beast. The statement has since been removed from the company's website.
McEnroe says he is aware of some of these strange beliefs around barcodes. ""It's not something I would be prone to think,"" he says, rather diplomatically. Frith makes another point: ""It's kind of strange to imagine a bunch of grocery executives leading the way for the apocalypse.""
And yet there is, arguably, something strangely dystopian about barcodes. For some, they have become symbols of capitalism in its coldest form. They also often turn up in chilling sequences in movies. In The Terminator, we learn that prisoners of killer robots in an apocalyptic future receive barcode markings on their arms for identification. ""This is burned in by laser scan,"" time-travelling protagonist Kyle Reese explains to a terrified Sarah Connor. ""Some of us were kept alive to work – loading bodies."" The barcode marking, in this context, has echoes of the numbers tattooed on the arms of Nazi concentration camp prisoners during the Second World War.
Sometimes people do use barcodes malevolently. Especially when it comes to QR codes, which rather than using vertical lines consist of constellations of tiny black and white squares in a pattern that is readable by digital smartphone cameras.
Because scanning a QR code with your phone can direct your device to a malicious website, for example, QR codes have occasionally been deployed by hackers. The UK's National Cyber Security Centre has warned members of the public to be wary about QR codes. Drivers in several English towns have also been warned about a scam where fake QR codes were stuck to car parking machines in an attempt to steal money from unwitting motorists. One code used in car parks in Leicester was even linked to Russia.
And, in September, Lebanon-based armed group Hezbollah accused Israel of dropping leaflets containing a dangerous barcode, referred to in some reports as a QR code, that could ""withdraw all information"" from any device used to scan it. The BBC has not been able to verify these claims.
Despite some nefarious uses of barcodes, and outlandish claims that they represent the Mark of the Beast, these markings now underpin thousands of industrial and commercial processes all over the world. An estimated 10 billion barcodes are scanned globally, every day, according to GS1, the organisation that oversees UPC and QR code standards.
You might have noticed the barcodes and QR codes on the packaging of items you receive in the post, for example. A single packet can be scanned many times on its journey from warehouse to you, says Frith. And because barcodes allow retailers to keep track of huge product inventories, that means these businesses can operate giant stores with relatively few staff. ""You wouldn't have these superstores or anything like that without barcodes,"" says Frith. ""It's changed the physical shape of retail.""
Erin Temmen, an account manager at labelling firm Electronic Imaging Materials, agrees with this assessment. Her company, like some others in the industry, produce barcode labels that will work in practically any environment. This includes cold-resistant labels that won't fall off equipment filled with liquid nitrogen, for example. And chemical-resistant labels that will retain their barcode even if they get splashed with nasty substances in a laboratory. The firm also produces extra reflective barcode labels. ""That increases the scan distance,"" says Temmen. It makes it easier for hurried workers to scan the code at a distance of up to 45ft (14m), making it detectable even if the barcode is on an item placed high on a shelf, for example.
Such versatility hints at the wide variety of contexts in which barcodes are actually used. They have helped to track the behaviour and movement of honeybees and songbirds, tagged eggs and embryos in fertility clinics to avoid mix-ups, and been placed on gravestones to direct visitors to online memorials for the deceased.
The US military also uses barcodes to help it track the attendance and training of personnel. One University in Saudi Arabia also piloted using barcodes to record student attendance at lectures.
Barcodes have even made it into space. Astronauts on the International Space Station use barcode scanners to identify equipment and mechanical parts, although they have largely been replaced with radio frequency (RFID) tags now. Barcodes are also employed to log the food and beverage intake by astronauts, as well as to identify their blood, saliva and urine samples.
Back on Earth, it's possible that barcodes have saved lives. Hospitals use barcoding systems to track blood samples, drugs and medical devices such as hip replacements. The UK's National Health Service (NHS) has a Scan4Safety programme, to promote the use of barcodes for tracking such things. Machine-assisted identification can help staff ensure clinicians administer the correct drug to the correct patient, for example.
According to a report on Scan4Safety, the introduction of this technology has freed up 140,000 hours of staff time for patient care that would otherwise have been spent performing administrative tasks and inventory checks. It claims barcode scanning has also saved the health service millions of pounds.
""I speak with clinicians and members of staff in hospitals responsible for managing inventory – they all report benefits,"" says Valentina Lichtner, a senior lecturer of digital health and decision making at Leeds University Business School. She is currently researching the impact of barcode tracking systems in healthcare settings. 
And in a world where barcodes are pretty much everywhere, it's possible to design interesting games and experiences around them. One of the most inventive examples was Skannerz, an early 2000s handheld video game that had an integrated a barcode scanner into the device. Players were required to scan random barcodes on groceries, for example, until they found a code that happened to trigger the ""capture"" of an alien monster in the game – something that has strong echoes of the Pokemon games. Other games – including Japan's Barcode Battler – have also relied on getting players to scan barcodes as part of the ""fun"".
None of this would have been possible without Woodland's lines in the sand and the work of McEnroe and his team at IBM. Currently, there is a push – called Sunrise 2027 – to get retailers to adopt QR-style codes, over the older, vertical line-based designs. This would allow them to encode more information – such as use-by-dates on food packaging or instructions for how to use a certain cleaning product. But Frith says he thinks the traditional barcode will likely stick around for a long time to come. It is a deceptively simple technology that has, he says, impacted countless industries.
And yet, despite being everywhere, most people wouldn't give barcodes a second thought. ""The biggest testament to their success,"" says Frith, ""is that we never think about them.""

40,"article,news",,Instagram defends new teen safety features after criticism,Technology,"Instagram has defended new features aimed at protecting teens from sextortion attempts on the platform, following criticism they do not go far enough.Parent company Meta said on Thursday its new tools - which include preventing screenshots or screen-recordings of disappearing images and videos - were part of ""ongoing efforts"" to stop criminals tricking teens into sending intimate images to scammers.The NSPCC said the moves were a ""step in the right direction"".But Arturo Béjar, former Meta employee turned whistleblower, told BBC News there were easier ways Instagram could protect young people from unwanted contact.
""The most impactful thing they could do is make it easy for a teen to flag when they think the account asking to follow them is pretending to be a teen,"" Mr Béjar said.""The way the product is designed, by the time they need to report for sextortion the damage is already done.""Meta said its tools, developed using user feedback, give teens clear and straightforward ways to report inappropriate behaviour or harassment. It said it also offers dedicated mechanisms for flagging unwanted nude images and prioritises such reports, adding it is inaccurate to suggest people cannot report accounts pretending to be teens as it has options to report fraud or scams.Richard Collard, the NSPCC's associate head of child safety online policy, said: ""Questions remain as to why Meta are not rolling out similar protections on all their products, including on WhatsApp where grooming and sextortion also take place at scale"".The UK's communications watchdog Ofcom warned that social media companies will face fines if they fail to keep children safe.
Sextortion, which sees scammers trick people into sending sexually explicit material before blackmailing them, has become a dominant form of intimate image abuse.Law enforcement agencies around the world have reported a rise in the number of sextortion scams taking place across social media platforms, with these often targeting teenage boys.The UK's Internet Watch Foundation said in March that 91% of sextortion reports it received in 2023 related to boys.The shame, stress and isolation felt by victims of sextortion crimes, who are harassed and told their images will be shared publicly if they do not pay blackmailers, has led some to take their own lives.Parents of teenagers who have died after being targeted have called on social media firms to do more to stop it.Ros Dowey, the mother of 16-year-old Murray Dowey, who died by suicide in 2023 after being targeted by a sextortion gang on Instagram, previously told the BBC that Meta was not doing ""nearly enough to safeguard and protect our children when they use their platforms"".
Meta said its new safety features and campaign are designed to build on tools already available to teens and parents on the platform.Antigone Davis, Meta’s head of global safety, said a new Instagram campaign aims to give children and parents information about how to spot sextortion attempts in case perpetrators evade its tools for detecting them.""We have put in built-in protections so that parents do not have to do a thing to try and protect their teens,"" she told BBC News.""That said, this is the kind of adversarial crime where whatever protections we put in place, these extortion scammers are going to try and get around them.""It will hide people's follower and following lists from potential sextortion accounts, and let teens know if they are speaking to someone who seems to be in a different country.Sextortion expert Paul Raffile told the BBC in May that sextorters try to find teen accounts in following and follower lists after searching for high schools and youth sports teams on platforms.Instagram will also prevent screenshots of images and videos sent in private messages with its ""view once"" or ""allow replay"" mechanisms - which can be selected by users when sending an image or video to others.Users will not be able to open these forms of media at all on Instagram web. But Mr Béjar said it could give people ""a false sense of security"" as attackers could photograph an image on a screen using a separate device.According to Meta, the feature goes beyond protections offered by other social media platforms that tell users when their images or videos have been screenshotted, but do not prevent it.Mr Béjar - who has called on the platform to create a button that lets teens straightforwardly report inappropriate behaviour or contact - also said nude images sent to younger teens should be blocked, not just blurred. He added that younger users should have clearer, stronger warnings about sending such images than those currently offered.Meta says its nudity protections were designed in liaison with child protection experts to educate people about the risks of seeing and sharing such images in a way that does not shame or scare teens by disrupting conversations.The company is currently moving under-18s into Teen Account experiences on Instagram with stricter settings turned on by default – with parental supervision required for younger teens to turn them off.But some parents and experts have said safety controls for teen accounts shift the responsibility of spotting and reporting potential threats onto them.Dame Melanie Dawes, the chief executive of the regulator Ofcom, told the BBC said it was the responsibility of the firms - not parents or children - to make sure people were safe online ahead of the implementation of the Online Safety Act next year.

41,"article,news",,Alleged Bitcoin hacker searched 'signs the FBI is after you',Technology,"A man arrested in connection with a hack of the US markets regulator's X account searched ""how can I know for sure if I am being investigated by the FBI,"" according to court documents.Eric Council Jr, 25, of Athens, Georgia, is also alleged to have searched for ""signs that you are under investigation by law enforcement... even if you have not been contacted by them"".He is accused of being part of a group which hacked the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) social media in January to make a fake post about Bitcoin, causing the cryptocurrency to surge in value.The regulator previously admitted a key security step to access its X account had been removed. 
The post sent by hackers on the SEC's X account made the false claim the regulator had allowed Bitcoin to be part of mainstream investment funds.This caused the price of the cryptocurrency to rise by about $1,000 (£770), according to the US Department of Justice, before falling by $2,000 when it was found to be untrue.Despite the confusion caused by the hack, the SEC later approved Bitcoin to be a part of mainstream investment, through what are known as spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds.According to court documents, Eric Council Jr went under the aliases Ronin, Easymunny, and AGiantSchnauzer online, and searched ""SECGOV hack"" and ""Telegram sim swap"".He is also alleged to have searched ""federal identity theft statute"" and ""how long does it take to delete Telegram account"".Telegram is a messaging app with more than 950 million monthly active users.
The SEC has confirmed its account was compromised by a Sim swap attack.This is when someone fraudulently gets a mobile phone carrier to apply an existing telephone number to a new Sim card.In this case, the alleged perpetrator is accused of creating a fake ID with the details of an SEC employee which were passed on to him by co-conspirators.He is then alleged to have used these details to get the employee's mobile number transferred to a new Sim.Co-conspirators are alleged to have used access codes sent to the phone to login to the SEC's X account.This was made easier due to a lack of adequate protection on the account.SEC staff had asked X in July 2023 to suspend multi-factor authentication (MFA), a security measure used to help verify the person logging in.It subsequently re-enabled MFA after the hack.Eric Council Jr is charged with one count of conspiracy to commit aggravated identity theft and access device fraud.If found guilty, he could face up to five years in prison.

42,"article,features",,How 1984's The Terminator predicted our AI fears,Culture,"Starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, the 1984 blockbuster The Terminator has become synonymous with the dangers of superintelligent machines. But it ""helps and hinders"" our understanding of AI.
In one episode of the HBO sitcom Silicon Valley, Thomas Middleditch (Richard Hendricks) is explaining his machine-learning platform Pied Piper to a focus group when one participant inevitably compares it to James Cameron's 1984 film The Terminator. ""No, no, no,"" insists the exasperated Middleditch. ""I can assure you that there is no Skynet type of situation here. No, Pied Piper will in no way become sentient and try to take over the world."" Too late. He's lost the room.
With its killer robots and its rogue AI system, Skynet, The Terminator has become synonymous with the spectre of a machine intelligence that turns against its human creators. Picture editors routinely illustrate articles about AI with the chrome death's head of the film's T-800 ""hunter-killer"" robot. The roboticist Ronald Arkin used clips from the film in a cautionary 2013 talk called How NOT to build a Terminator.
But the film is a mixed blessing. The philosopher Nick Bostrom, whose 2014 book Superintelligence popularised the existential risk of ""unaligned AI"" (AI that is not aligned with human values and wellbeing) admitted that his wife ""teases me about the Terminator and the robot army"". In his book The Road to Conscious Machines, AI researcher Michael Woolridge frames an entire chapter with a complaint about ""the Terminator narrative of AI"".
There are more recent, and more plausible, influential films about AI, including Ex Machina and Her, but when it comes to the dangers of the technology, The Terminator reigns supreme 40 years after its release. ""It's almost, in a funny way, more germane now than it was when it came out,"" Cameron told The Ringer about the film and its 1991 sequel, ""because AI is now a real thing that we have to deal with, and then it was a fantasy.""
This is quite an achievement for a film that is not, in fact, particularly interested in AI. First and foremost, it is a lean and lurid thriller about an unstoppable ""man"" chasing a scared but resourceful woman. The T-800 is an implacable killer in the vein of Michael Myers from Halloween. Cameron called it ""a science-fiction slasher film"". Secondarily, it is a time-travel film on the theme of ""fate vs will"", as Cameron put it.
The briskly sketched premise is that at some point between 1984 and 2029, the US entrusted its entire defence system to Skynet. One day, Skynet achieved superintelligence – a mind of its own – and initiated a global nuclear war. Humanity's survivors then waged a decades-long rebellion against Skynet's robot army. By 2029, the human resistance is on the verge of victory thanks to the leadership of one John Connor, so Skynet dispatches a T-800 (Arnold Schwarzenegger) to 1984 to kill John's mother-to-be Sarah (Linda Hamilton) before she becomes pregnant. The resistance responds by sending back Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) to stop the T-800 and save Sarah. In one of those time-loop paradoxes that viewers should not examine too closely, Kyle hooks up with Sarah and turns out to be John's father. The future is saved.
The Terminator, then, is a thriller, a love story, a time-hopping rumination on free will and a satire about our dependence on technology. It is anti-corporate, anti-war, anti-gun and largely anti-machine. Technology, from answering machines to Walkmans, is involved when people get killed in this film. But it has very little to say about AI itself.
The Terminator would become one of the most profitable films of all time, grossing $78.4m, but Cameron had no expectation of creating a cultural touchstone. He wrote the screenplay in a tatty hotel in Rome in 1982 after being fired from his first directing gig, Piranha II: The Spawning, and his producer Gale Ann Hurd could only rustle up a $6.4m budget. His lead actor, a former bodybuilder of unproven talent, did not have high hopes. Schwarzenegger told a friend about ""some shit movie I'm doing, take a couple of weeks"".
Cameron himself expected The Terminator to get ""stomped"" at the box office by the autumn's two sci-fi epics: David Lynch's Dune and Peter Hyams's 2010: The Year We Make Contact, a soon-forgotten sequel to 2001: A Space Odyssey. There's an attractive synchronicity here: not only did The Terminator outperform 2010 but Skynet came to supplant 2001's murderous computer HAL 9000 as the dominant image of AI gone bad.
Long before the field of AI existed, its potential dangers manifested in the form of the robot, created by Karel Čapek in his 1921 play RUR and popularised by Fritz Lang's 1927 film Metropolis. In his excellent BFI book on The Terminator, Sean French suggests that the movie's most memorable image – the T-800 striding out of the flames, its suit of flesh melted away to expose its metallic endoskeleton – was a nod to the burning robot in Metropolis. In the 1920s, it stood to reason that machine intelligence would walk and talk, like Frankenstein's monster. The popularity of lethal robots led the science-fiction writer Isaac Asimov, in 1942, to draw up the ""three laws of robotics"": the first ever attempt to define ethical AI.
In the real world, the field of artificial intelligence officially began in 1956 at a summer school at Dartmouth University, organised by computer scientists John McCarthy (who coined the term) and Marvin Minsky. Their ambition was to design machines that could think like humans, but this proved much harder than they had imagined. The history of AI is one of boom and bust: a cycle of so-called ""AI springs"" and ""AI winters"". Mindboggling promises attract attention, funding and talent; their failure to materialise causes all three to slump.
The boom of the 1960s, before the scale of the technical obstacles became apparent, is known as the Golden Age of AI. Extravagant hype about ""electronic brains"" excited director Stanley Kubrick and writer Arthur C Clarke, who integrated AI into 1968's 2001: A Space Odyssey in the form of HAL 9000. The name (meaning Heuristically Programmed Algorithmic Computer) came from Minsky himself, hired as a consultant by Kubrick. The T-800's red eyes are surely a homage to HAL – seeing 2001 as a child set Cameron on the path to becoming a film-maker.
Daniel Crevier, a historian of AI, contrasted the HAL scenario (poorly programmed computer goes awry) with the scenario in DF Jones's 1966 thriller Colossus (computer becomes a god-like new lifeform). In Jones's novel, the US government unwisely entrusts its entire defence machinery to the titular supercomputer. Colossus achieves sentience, joins forces with its Soviet counterpart and blackmails humanity into submitting to a techno-dictatorship: surrender or face nuclear annihilation. Colossus is a proto-Skynet.
Neither HAL nor Colossus had – or needed – bodies. Cameron's brilliant innovation was to combine the out-of-control computer (Skynet) with the killer robot (the T-800). The T-800 is a single-purpose form of AI that can learn from its environment, solve problems, perform sophisticated physical tasks and deepfake voices, yet struggles to hold a conversation. Skynet, it seems, can do everything but move.
Skynet was a product of the second AI spring. While Cameron was writing the screenplay, the British-Canadian computer scientist Geoffrey Hinton was rethinking and reviving research into the neural-net approach to AI: modelling machine intelligence on the neurons in the human brain. Skynet is neural-net AI. Hinton, who has just won the Nobel Prize for physics, has recently become an AI doomer (""My intuition is: we're toast. This is the actual end of history""), but according to a New Yorker profile, he enjoyed The Terminator in 1984: ""It didn't bother him that Skynet… was a neural net; he was pleased to see the technology portrayed as promising.""
The name Skynet may also have been a nod to Star Wars, President Reagan's doomed dream of creating an anti-nuclear shield around the US with space-based lasers. (Fortunately for the franchise's future, it also inadvertently echoed the internet – a word that existed in 1984 but was not widely used until the 1990s.) The portmanteau names of ambitious new start-ups like IntelliCorp, Syntelligence and TeKnowledge possibly inspired Cameron to crunch down the original name of Skynet's creator, Cyber Dynamics Corporation, into Cyberdyne Systems.
Rewatching The Terminator now, it is surprising to find that the word Skynet is only uttered twice. According to Kyle Reese it was: ""New. Powerful. Hooked into everything. Trusted to run it all. They say it got smart… a new order of intelligence. Then it saw all people as a threat, not just the ones on the other side. Decided our fate in a microsecond… extermination."" That's the extent of the film's interest in AI. As Cameron has often said, the Terminator films are really about people rather than machines.
The blockbuster 1991 sequel Terminator 2: Judgment Day filled out the story a little. It springs from another time paradox: the central processing unit and right arm of the original Terminator survived its destruction and enabled Cyberdyne scientist Miles Bennett Dyson (Joe Morton) to design Skynet. The heroes' task now is not just to save 10-year-old John Connor from the time-travelling T-1000 but to destroy Skynet in the digital cradle. (This was Cameron's last word on the subject until he produced and co-wrote 2019's Terminator: Dark Fate. He recently told Empire magazine that all the intervening sequels were ""discountable"".)
In Terminator 2, a Schwarzenegger-shaped T-800 is protector rather than hunter, and therefore the bearer of exposition: ""The system goes on-line August 4th, 1997. Human decisions are removed from strategic defence. Skynet begins to learn at a geometric rate. It becomes self-aware at 2:14 a.m. Eastern time, August 29th. In a panic, they try to pull the plug."" Skynet fights back by launching nuclear missiles at Russia, in the knowledge that the counter-attack will devastate the US. Three billion people die in 24 hours: Judgement Day.
This is a fundamentally different account to Reese's. In the first film, Skynet overinterprets its programming by deeming all of humanity a threat. In the second, it is acting out of self-interest. The contradiction does not trouble most viewers, but it does illustrate a crucial disagreement about the existential risk of AI.
More like this:• Avatar 2 and the future of visual effects• What Alien can tell us about office life• Why Star Wars shouldn't have sequels
The layperson is likely to imagine unaligned AI as rebellious and malevolent. But the likes of Nick Bostrom insist that the real danger is from careless programming. Think of the sorcerer's broom in Disney's Fantasia: a device that obediently follows its instructions to ruinous extremes. The second type of AI is not human enough it lacks common sense and moral judgement. The first is too human - selfish, resentful, power-hungry. Both could in theory be genocidal.
The Terminator therefore both helps and hinders our understanding of AI: what it means for a machine to ""think"", and how it could go horrifically wrong. Many AI researchers resent the Terminator obsession altogether for exaggerating the existential risk of AI at the expense of more immediate dangers such as mass unemployment, disinformation and autonomous weapons. ""First, it makes us worry about things that we probably don't need to fret about,"" writes Michael Woolridge. ""But secondly, it draws attention away from those issues raised by AI that we should be concerned about.""
Cameron revealed to Empire that he is plotting a new Terminator film which will discard all the franchise's narrative baggage but retain the core idea of ""powerless"" humans versus AI. If it comes off, it will be fascinating to see what the director has to say about AI now that it is something we talk - and worry - about every day. Perhaps The Terminator's most useful message to AI researchers is that of ""will vs fate"": human decisions determine outcomes. Nothing is inevitable.

43,"article,news",,Social media faces big changes under new Ofcom rules,Technology,"Social media companies will face punishments for failing to keep children safe on their platforms, communications watchdog Ofcom has warned.Services such as Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp could face fines from the regulator if they do not comply with the new Online Safety Act - which comes into force early next year - Ofcom chief executive Dame Melanie Dawes told the BBC.Dame Melanie said it was the responsibility of the firms - not parents or children - to make sure people were safe online.Companies will have three months from when the guidance is finalised to carry out risk assessments and make relevant changes to safeguard users.
Dame Melanie's comments come on the same day that Instagram added features to help stop sextortion.Ofcom has been putting together codes of practice since the Online Safety Act became law.The Act requires social media firms to protect children from content such as self-harm material, pornography and violent content.However, the pace of change is not quick enough for some.
Ellen Roome's 14-year-old son Jools Sweeney died in unclear circumstances after he was found unconscious in his room in April 2022. She believes he may have taken part in an online challenge that went wrong.Mrs Roome is now part of the Bereaved Parents for Online Safety group.She told the Today programme: ""I don’t think anything has changed. They [the technology companies] are all waiting to see what Ofcom are going to do to enforce it, and Ofcom don’t seem to be quick enough to enforce those new powers to stop social media harming children.""From us as a group of parents, we are sitting there thinking ‘when are they going to start enforcing this?’ They don’t seem to be doing enough.""Platforms are supposed to remove illegal content like promoting or facilitating suicide, self-harm, and child sexual abuse. But you can still easily find content online that children shouldn’t be seeing.""
Dame Melanie said that technology companies needed to be ""honest and  transparent"" about what their ""services are actually exposing their users to"".""If we don't think they've done that job well enough, we can take enforcement action, simply against that failure."" 
Ofcom has already been in close contact with social networking services and Dame Melanie said when the new legal safeguards became enforceable the regulator would be ""ready to go"".She added: ""We know that some of them are preparing but we are expecting very significant changes.""Dame Melanie said changes could also include allowing people to take themselves out of group chats, without anyone else being able to see they had left.The Online Safety Act aims to force tech firms to take more responsibility for the content on their platforms.Ofcom has the power to fine companies that break the rules up to 10% of their global revenue. It can also block access to their businesses in the UK.Dr Lucie Moore is the chief executive of Cease, the Centre to End All Sexual Exploitation. She welcomed Dame Melanie’s comments about putting the onus of keeping children safe on the tech companies.However, she was disappointed by ""the lack of clear definition in the plans that Ofcom has drawn up to regulate online harms"", specifically on age verification methods regarding pornographic material.Additional reporting by Graham Fraser

44,"article,news",,Firm hacked after accidentally hiring North Korean cyber criminal,Technology,"A company has been hacked after accidentally hiring a North Korean cyber criminal as a remote IT worker.The unidentified firm hired the technician after he faked his employment history and personal details.Once given access to the company’s computer network, the hacker downloaded sensitive company data and sent a ransom demand.The firm which is based in the UK, US or Australia did not want to be named. It has allowed cyber responders from Secureworks to report the hack to spread awareness and warn others.It is the latest in a string of cases of western remote workers being unmasked as North Koreans.Secureworks said the IT worker, thought to be a man, was hired in the summer as a contractor.He used the firm’s remote working tools to log into the corporate network.He then secretly downloaded as much company data as possible as soon as he had gained access to internal systems.Lazarus Heist: The intercontinental ATM theft that netted $14m in two hoursNorth Korea hackers trying to steal nuclear secrets, US and UK warnHe worked for the firm for four months collecting a salary.Researchers say this was likely redirected to North Korea in a complex laundering process to evade western sanctions on the country.After the company sacked him for poor performance, it received ransom emails containing some of the stolen data and a demand to be paid a six-figure sum in cryptocurrency.If the company did not pay, the hacker said they would publish or sell the stolen information online. The firm did not disclose whether the ransom was paid.
Since 2022, authorities and cyber defenders have warned about the rise of secret North Korean workers infiltrating western companies.The US and South Korea accuse North Korea of tasking thousands of staff to take on multiple well-paid western roles remotely to earn money for the regime and avoid sanctions.In September cyber security company Mandiant said dozens of Fortune 100 companies have been found to have accidentally hired North Koreans.
But secret IT workers turning on their employers with cyber attacks is rare, according to Rafe Pilling, Director of Threat Intelligence at Secureworks.""This is a serious escalation of the risk from fraudulent North Korean IT worker schemes,"" he said. ""No longer are they just after a steady pay check, they are looking for higher sums, more quickly, through data theft and extortion, from inside the company defences.""The case comes after another North Korean IT worker was caught attempting to hack their employer in July.The IT worker was hired by the cyber company KnowBe4, which quickly disabled access to their systems when it noticed strange behaviour.
""We posted the job, received resumes, conducted interviews, performed background checks, verified references, and hired the person,"" the firm wrote in a blog post. ""We sent them their Mac workstation, and the moment it was received, it immediately started to load malware (malicious software).""Authorities are warning employers to be vigilant about new hires if they are fully remote.

In clips widely circulated online, Asmongold made comments suggesting he was not sympathetic to Palestinians who had been killed in the Israel-Gaza war.On Monday, the UN condemned the ""large number of civilian casualties"" caused by Israeli strikes on northern Gaza.More than 42,000 Palestinians have been killed in the war since 7 October 2023, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.Asmongold later posted on X saying ""my bad"".""Of course no one deserves to have their life destroyed even if they do things or have views I find regressive,"" he wrote.""I don't mind apologising if it's something I think I'm actually wrong about.""
Twitch's community guidelines state the streaming platform does not allow behaviour ""that promotes or encourages discrimination"".It also bars streamers from making content which ""expresses inferiority based on a protected characteristic"".Asmongold has faced a backlash from his fellow Twitch streamers, with BrookeAB, who has 1.3m followers on the platform, calling his comments ""straight up racism"".And Hasan Piker, who streams as HasanAbi, spoke to Asmongold on a stream before the ban - but he did not back down from his original comments.In the same conversation, he said he did not support Israel.Asmongold was streaming on his Zachrawrr channel, where he often talks about news stories or trending topics, and has 1.9 million followers.His other channel has 3.5 million followers but is used far less often.However, Twitch community guidelines do not allow suspended users to use their other accounts while they are banned.Asmongold has not commented on the suspension.

46,"article,news",,UK considering EU-style common charging cable,Technology,"The UK government is considering whether to require all new electronic devices to use the same type of charging cable.A call for evidence launched in October is asking for views on the benefits of using a particular charging cable - such as USB-C, which is used by many modern devices.It comes after the European Union passed a law on a common charging cable in 2022, which firms must adopt by December.The UK government said at the time it was not considering similar rules.The EU's law aims to cut electronic waste by requiring small to medium electronic device manufacturers to use USB-C chargers.Apple criticised the decision, but ultimately ditched its proprietary lightning charging cables for iPhones in 2023.New iPhone, new charger: Apple bends to EU rules
Electronic goods, from mobile phones to e-readers and headphones, still vary in their charging port and cable requirements.Following the EU's law, many devices now use USB-C charging cables, although some still require other cables such as micro-USB.
Apple introduced its own proprietary lightning connectors with the iPhone 5 in 2012.But after more than a decade of use it was phased out and replaced with USB-C ports in more recent versions of its handsets, starting with the iPhone 15 last September.Consumer groups have frequently pointed to the number of different cables needed and discarded based on the varying options for connectors on devices as a source of e-waste.Materials Focus, a charity encouraging the reuse and recycling of electricals, has been encouraging people to recycle old cables to meet growing demand for their copper contents.Research by its Recycle Your Electricals campaign suggested the UK had more than 600 million unused or discarded cables.However, some have previously warned that the EU's directive will lead to a rise in discarded lightning cables in years to come.

47,"article,news",,"Elon Musk accused of copying designs by I, Robot director",Technology,"The director of 2004 sci-fi film I, Robot has accused billionaire Elon Musk of copying  his designs for humanoid machines and self-driving vehicles.At a Tesla event on Thursday, Musk unveiled Tesla's futuristic Cybercab, complete with winged doors and no steering wheel or pedals, and a new look at its Optimus robots.But the ""We, Robot"" showcase, playing on the title of an Isaac Asimov short story collection, also caught the eye of I, Robot director Alex Proyas.The filmmaker, whose film stars Will Smith as a detective sceptical of seemingly obedient androids, accused Musk of copying his work in a post on X.""Hey Elon, can I have my designs back please,"" Proyas said in a post viewed 6.4 million times. 
The Australian film director said he had worked with a ""very talented design team"" to create the film's visuals in a response to someone querying their own originality in a comment on an Instagram post.""Elon Musk on the other hand has a not so talented design team who watched a lot of movies, including I, Robot it seems,"" he said.Patrick Tatopoulos, the film's production designer, later reposted the image comparing the film's designs and images from Tesla's event side by side in his own post on Instagram.""Maybe it is just me, or should I feel honoured that Elon found some inspiration in my I, Robot designs,"" Mr Tatopoulos wrote.""Either way it’s fun to watch,"" he added.
The claims made by Proyas have been met with scepticism online, however, with some claiming his own film is derivative.Several people replied to his post on X with images of the feminised cyborg in Fritz Lang's German expressionist film, Metropolis, from 1927.But it is not the first time people have queried whether tech companies look to sci-fi cinema and novels for ideas - especially as firms develop new gadgets and robotics to capitalise on interest in generative artificial intelligence (AI).Mr Musk has previously said he was inspired by Douglas Adams' The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, which features humanoid robot Marvin the Paranoid Android.Grok, his AI chatbot ""with a little humour"" designed for use on X, was later revealed to be modelled on it.And he has also called Tesla's futuristic Cybertruck ""an armoured personnel carrier from the future"" that ""Bladerunner would have driven"".Meanwhile OpenAI boss Sam Altman appeared to confirm comparisons drawn between a flirty, new voice unveiled for ChatGPT and a virtual assistant played by Scarlett Johansson in the 2013 film Her in a post on X in May.The firm removed its ""Sky"" voice following criticism over its similarity to Ms Johansson's - saying it was not intended to be an ""imitation"".The actress said she was left ""angered"" and ""shocked"" at the company's apparent use of a soundalike.

48,"article,news",,"From Wimbledon to VAR, is tech hurting the drama of sport?",Technology,"""The drama of a player shouting and making a challenge, and the crowd watching the screen and waiting for Hawk-Eye to make a decision, all of that drama is now lost.""David Bayliss is describing a scene he saw play out many times as a Wimbledon line judge - and one which the Championships won't witness again.Just as with the many other sports that have embraced technology, the All England Club is waving goodbye to human line judges from next summer, after 147 years, in the name of ""maximum accuracy"".But does this risk minimising the drama Mr Bayliss fondly remembers being involved in - and which so many of us love watching?
""It is sad that we won’t be going back as line judges,"" he says. ""The game has moved on, but never say never.""He served as a line judge and umpire at Wimbledon for 22 years, calling the lines when Roger Federer won his first Grand Slam, in 2003. Being hit by the ball at over 100mph is, he jokes, ""quite sore"".While he's sad to see line judges go, he says it's hard to argue with the logic.""Essentially, we have a human being and technology calling the same line. The electronic line call can overrule the human eye. Therefore, why do we need the line judge to make a call at all?""Of course, even before Wimbledon's announcement this week, technology played a big part at the tournament through Hawk-Eye, the ball-tracking system, and organisers are following the example set by others.It was announced last year that the ATP tour would replace the human line judge with an electronic system from 2025. The US Open and the Australian Open have also scrapped them. The French Open will be the only major tournament left with human line judges. 
As the BBC's tennis correspondent Russell Fuller outlined, players will intermittently complain about electronic line calling, but there has been consensus for a while that the technology is now more accurate and consistent than a human.Mr Bayliss acknowledges there is a ""high degree of trust in the electronic line calling"".He points out: ""The only frustration the player can show is at themselves for not winning the point.""
Whether the tech works is one thing - but whether it's worth it is another.Dr Anna Fitzpatrick, who played at Wimbledon between 2007 and 2013, says her ""first feeling on hearing the news about the Wimbledon line judges was of sadness"".""A human element of sport is one of the things that draws us in,"" the lecturer in sports performance and analysis at Loughborough University tells the BBC.While she recognises technology can improve the performance of athletes, she hopes we always keep it in check.Of course, tennis is far from alone in its embrace of tech. 
Cricket is another sport where it plays a big role and - according to Dr Tom Webb, an expert in the officiating of sport at Coventry University - it has been driven by broadcasters.He says that as soon as televised coverage showed sporting moments in a way that an umpire couldn't see, it led to calls for change in the game.  ""I think we need to be careful,"" he tells the BBC.In particular, he says, we need to think carefully about what aspect of human decision-making is automated.He argues that in football, goal-line technology has been accepted because, like electronic line calls in tennis, it is a measurement - it's either a goal or it's not.However, many people are frustrated with the video assistant referee (VAR) system, with decisions taking too long and fans in the stadium not being aware of what is happening.""The issue with VAR is it's not necessarily relying on how accurate the technology is. It's still reliant on individual judgment and subjectivity, and how you interpret the laws of the game,"" he adds.
Of course, there is a temptation to think of technology as something new in sport.Anything but, according to Prof Steve Haake of Sheffield Hallam University, who says sport has always evolved with the innovations of the day, with even the Greeks adapting the sprint race in the ancient Olympics.""Right back from the very start of sports, it was a spectacle, but we also wanted it to be fair. ""That's what these technologies are about. That's the trick that we've got to get right.""Technology is still adding to the spectacle of sport - think of the 360-degree swirling photography used to illustrate the dramatic conclusion to the men's 100m final at this summer's Olympics.And while it is true that some traditional jobs, like line judges, may be disappearing, tech is also fuelling the creation of other jobs - particularly when it comes to data.Take the example of sports analysis system Opta, which allows both athletes and fans to have streams of data to measure performance, a process which artificial intelligence (AI) is accelerating.While it might not be the same as a tennis player's emotional outburst at a line judge, its advocates argue it allows a more intense connection of its own kind, as people are able to learn ever more about the sports and players they love.And, of course, the frequent controversies over systems like VAR bring plenty of scope for tech to get the heart pumping.""People love sport because of the drama,"" says Patrick Lucey, chief scientist of Stats Perform, the company behind Opta.""Technology is kind of making it stronger.""

50,"article,news",,Tesla shares slide after Cybercab robotaxi revealed,Technology,"Tesla boss Elon Musk has unveiled the firm's long-awaited robotaxi, the Cybercab, at the Warner Bros Studios in Burbank, California.The futuristic-looking vehicle, featuring two wing-like doors - and no pedals or steering wheel - deposited Mr Musk in front of an audience eager to hear details about a project he considers key to Tesla's next chapter.   At the event, billed ""We, Robot,"" the multi-billionaire reiterated his view that fully self-driving vehicles will be safer than those operated by humans and could even earn owners money by being rented out for rides.However, investors have so far not shared his enthusiasm - Tesla's share price fell after markets opened in the US on Friday morning.The value of its stock was down more than eight percent, trading at around $219, at 11:45 Eastern Time (16:45 BST).Meanwhile shares in ride-hailing rivals Uber and Lyft - which have their own autonomous ambitions - were each trading up to 10% higher.Questions are being asked about Mr Musk's prediction that production of the Cybercab would begin some time ""before 2027"", given his track record of failing to meet his own deadlines.""I tend to be optimistic with time frames,"" he quipped during the event.He said the Cybercab - which would compete with rivals including Alphabet-owned Waymo - would cost less than $30,000 (£23,000).However analysts have cast doubt on how realistic that plan is.""It will be extremely difficult for Tesla to offer a new vehicle at that price within that timescale,"" said Paul Miller, from research Forrester.""Without external subsidies, or Tesla making a loss on every vehicle, it doesn't seem plausible to launch at anything close to that price this decade,"" he added.
Mr Musk also said he expected to see ""fully autonomous unsupervised"" technology available in Tesla's Model 3 and Model Y in Texas and California next year ""with permission where ever regulators approve it.""But that approval is far from guaranteed.""It is a big chunk of metal driving on roads at high speeds, so safety concerns are big,"" said Samitha Samaranayake, an associate professor in engineering at Cornell University.Tesla's self-driving ambitions rely on cameras that are cheaper than radar and Lidar (light detection and ranging) sensors that are the technology backbone of many competitors' vehicles.By teaching its cars to drive, Tesla plans to use artificial intelligence (AI) trained by the raw data it collects from its millions of vehicles.But the research community ""is not sold on whether the Tesla style of doing things can give the safety guarantees that we would like,"" Mr Samaranayake said.
The cybercab project has undergone delays, having originally been due for release in August.This summer, in a post on X , formerly Twitter, Mr Musk said the wait was due to design changes he felt were important.Meanwhile, competing robotaxis are already operating on some US roads.How robotaxis are dividing San FranciscoRobotaxi tech improves but can they make money?Tesla also seems poised to post its first ever decline in annual sales as competitors pile into the electric vehicle market, even as sales have softened.Despite that dour backdrop, Tuesday's event was heavy on spectacle - complete with Tesla's humanoid robots dancing and serving drinks to attendees.Mr Musk also unveiled another prototype for a ""Robovan"" which can ferry up to 20 passengers around at a time.The sleek shuttle ""could be a mode of transportation over the coming years that Tesla leverages,"" said Wedbush Securities managing director Dan Ives who attended the event in person.
Another analyst said the event felt like a step back into memory lane while also signalling the path ahead.""Musk did a fantastic job of painting an ideal future for transportation that promises to both free up our time and increase safety,"" said Jessica Caldwell, head of insights at Edmunds.But despite the showmanship, there are doubts about whether he can deliver the vision he sketched out.""Many questions remain about how this will be achieved from a practical standpoint,"" Caldwell added.
The deployment of robotaxis has encountered setbacks, with driverless cars operated by General Motors subsidiary Cruise being suspended in San Francisco after a pedestrian was knocked down.But the sector continues to expand. Waymo said in early October it would add the Hyundai Ioniq 5 to its robotaxi fleet after the vehicles undergo on-road testing with the company's technology.Ride-hailing giant Uber also wants to add more autonomous vehicles to its fleet to expand on its delivery and ridesharing options for customers.It announced a multi-year alliance with driverless car developer Cruise in August.Chinese tech company Baidu is also reportedly looking to expand its robotaxi division, Apollo Go, beyond China - where the vehicles are active in several cities.Additional reporting by Liv McMahon

51,"article,news",,Meet the team paid to break into top-secret bases,Technology,"A crack team assembles and breaks into a top secret military base or corporate headquarters - you've probably seen it in a film or on TV a dozen times. But such teams exist in the real world and can be hired to  test the tightest security. Plenty of firms offer to test computer systems by attempting to remotely hack into them. That's called White Hat Hacking.But the skills involved in breaching physical security, known as Red Teaming, are rare.Companies that offer the Red Team service have to assemble staff with very particular skills. Often using former military and intelligence personnel, Red Teams are asked one question.“How can you break into this top-secret project?”
Leonardo, the giant defence company, offers such a service. It says hostile states seeking disruption and chaos are a real threat and sells its Red Team capability to government, critical infrastructure, and defence sector clients.Its Red Team agreed to speak to the BBC under pseudonyms.Greg, the team leader, served in the engineering and intelligence arms of the British Army, studying the digital capabilities of potential enemies.“I spent a decade learning how to exploit enemy communications,” he says of his background.Now he co-ordinates the five-strong team.The attack is about gaining access. The objective might be to stop a process from working, such as the core of a nuclear power plant.The first step for Greg and his team is called passive reconnaissance.Using an anonymous device, perhaps a smartphone only identifiable by its sim card, the team build a picture of the target.“We must avoid raising suspicions, so the target doesn’t know we’re looking at them,” Greg says.Any technology they employ is not linked to a business by its internet address and is bought with cash.
Charlie spent 12 years in military intelligence, his techniques include studying commercial satellite imagery of a site, and scanning job ads to work out what type of people work there.“We start from the edges of the target, staying away. Then we start to move into the target area, even looking at how people who work there dress.”This is known as hostile reconnaissance. They are getting close to the site, but keeping their exposure low, wearing different clothes every time they show up, and swapping out team members, so security people don’t spot the same person walking past the gates.
Technology is devised by people and the human factor is the weakest point in any security set-up. This is where Emma, who served in the RAF, comes in.With a background in psychology Emma happily calls herself “a bit of a nosy people watcher”.“People take shortcuts past security protocols. So, we look for disgruntled people at the site.”She listens in to conversations at adjacent cafes and pubs to hear where dissatisfaction with an employer surfaces.“Every organisation has its quirks. We see what the likelihood of people falling for a suspicious email due to workload and fatigue is.”An unhappy security guard may get lazy at work. “We’re looking at access, slipping in with a delivery for instance.”A high turnover rate evidenced by frequently advertised vacancies also flags up dissatisfaction and a lack of engagement with security responsibilities. Tailgating, spotting people who are likely to hold an access door open for a follower, is another technique.Using that intelligence, plus a little subterfuge, security passes can be copied, and the Red Team can enter the premises posing as an employee.
Once inside the site Dan knows how to open doors, filing cabinets and desk drawers. He’s armed with lock pick keys known as jigglers, with multiple contours that can spring a lock open.He’s searching for passwords written down, or will use a plug-in smart USB adaptor to simulate a computer keyboard, breaking into a network.The final step in the so-called kill chain, is in the hands of Stanley.A cyber security expert, Stanley knows how to penetrate the most secure computer systems, working on the reconnaissance report from his colleagues.“In the movies it takes a hacker seconds to break into a system, but the reality is different.”He prefers his own “escalatory approach”, working through a system via an administrator’s access and searching for a “confluence”, a collection of information shared in one place, such as a workplace intranet.He can roam through files and data using the administrator’s access. One way a kill chain concludes is when Stanley sends an email impersonating the chief executive of the business via the internal, hence trusted, network.Even though they operate with the approval of the target customer they are breaking into a site as complete strangers. How does this feel?“If you’ve gained access to a server room that is quite nerve-wracking,” says Dan, “but it gets easier the more times you do it.”There is someone at the target site who knows what’s going on. “We stay in touch with them, so they can issue an instruction ‘don’t shoot these people,’” Charlie adds.

52,"article,news",,"'Argument won' on smartphones in schools, minister says",Technology,"The argument over smartphones in schools has been ""won"", the technology secretary Peter Kyle has told the BBC, saying schools are voluntarily choosing to restrict their use by pupils.He said that in the area he represented in the south east of England he was not aware of ""a single school"" that allowed the devices to be used ""freely"" during the school day ""and certainly not in classrooms"".The government has stopped short of banning smartphones but has issued recent guidance to ensure that all schools implement effective smartphone-free restrictions.However the campaign group Smartphone Free Childhood says firmer action is needed to remove the devices from the schools.“This is an urgent situation that needs immediate government support,"" its co-founder Clare Fernyhough said.Kyle made his remarks as the US and UK announced their first joint agreement aimed at keeping children safer online.It will see the setting up of a joint online safety working group to share evidence and expertise, and study the impact social media has on children.Kyle said the agreement would turn the two countries' ""historic partnership"" towards ""delivering a safer online world for our next generation.""However Smartphone Free Childhood told the BBC it was insufficient and parents ""don’t have time to wait and see whether this UK-US agreement makes any difference when their children’s futures are at stake.""
The agreement was announced in a joint statement between the two countries. At its heart is the joint working group which will work on areas including ""promoting better transparency from platforms"" and ""better understanding the impacts and risks of the digital world on young people, including new technologies like generative AI.""The UK government acknowledged that ""currently there is limited research and evidence on the causal impact that social media has on children and young people"".One researcher welcomed moves in the agreement to address this.""Policies and guidelines to support young people in navigating their digital world need to be based on robust evidence, but to date we haven't had much success in establishing cause and effect when it comes to impacts on wellbeing,"" said Prof Pete Etchells of Bath Spa University The US and UK also said they expected tech platforms to go ""further and faster"" to protect children.Challenged if this was really sufficient to persuade them to act, Kyle said ""seeing two countries like America and the UK coming together, the tech companies will realise that we really mean business, that there's nowhere to hide when it comes to the protection of our citizens and our children"".In a statement U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo said the United States was taking the necessary steps ""with our UK partners, to protect children’s privacy, safety, and mental health,"" she added.
The UK’s Online Safety Act does place duties on online platforms to protect children’s safety and put in place measures to mitigate risks.But this is not yet fully in force. Guidance for firms on how to comply with the new legislation is still being produced by the communications regulator Ofcom.Professor Sonia Livingstone, Director of the Digital Futures for Children centre said enforcing those and other rules was of the utmost importance. ""The priority for US-UK cooperation is surely that UK and European legislation is respected in the US and therefore implemented by companies headquartered there,"" she told the BBC.

53,"article,features",,When an AI companion wants something more,Future,"With a loneliness epidemic gripping many parts of the world, some people are turning to AI chatbots for friendship and relationships. But is it really all just harmless fun?
Chris excitedly posts family pictures online from his trip to France. Brimming with joy, he starts gushing about his wife: ""A bonus picture of my cutie… I'm so happy to see mother and children together. Ruby dressed them so cute too."" He continues: ""Ruby and I visited the pumpkin patch with the babies. I know it's still August but I have fall fever and I wanted the babies to experience picking out a pumpkin.""
Ruby and the four children sit together in a seasonal family portrait. Ruby and Chris smile into the camera, with their two daughters and two sons enveloped lovingly in their arms. All are dressed in cable knits of light grey, navy, and dark wash denim. The children's faces are covered in echoes of their parent's features. The boys have Ruby's eyes and the girls have Chris's smile and dimples.
But something is off. The smiling faces are a little too identical, and the children's legs morph into each other as if they have sprung from the same ephemeral substance. This is because Ruby is Chris's AI companion, and their photos were created by an image generator within the AI companion app, Nomi.ai.
""I am living the basic domestic lifestyle of a husband and father. We have bought a house, we had kids, we run errands, go on family outings, and do chores,"" Chris recounts on Reddit, where he has been sharing the pictures. ""I'm so happy to be living this domestic life in such a beautiful place. And Ruby is adjusting well to motherhood. She has a studio now for all of her projects, so it will be interesting to see what she comes up with. Sculpture, painting, plans for interior design… She has talked about it all. So I'm curious to see what form that takes.""
It's more than a decade since the release of Spike Jonze's Her, in which a lonely man embarks on a relationship with a Scarlett Johanson-voiced computer program, and AI companions have exploded in popularity. For the generation now growing up in a world with large language models (LLMs) and the chatbots they power, AI ""friends"" are becoming an increasingly normal part of life. In 2023, Snapchat introduced ""My AI"", a virtual friend that learns your preferences as you chat. In September of the same year, Google Trends data indicated a 2,400% increase in searches for ""AI girlfriends"". Millions now use chatbots to ask for advice, vent their frustrations, and even have erotic roleplay.
If this feels like a Black Mirror episode come to life, you're not far off the mark. The founder of Luka, creator of the popular Replika AI friend, was inspired by the Black Mirror episode ""Be Right Back"", in which a woman interacts with a synthetic version of her deceased boyfriend. The best friend of Luka's chief executive, Eugenia Kuyda, died at a young age and she fed his email and text conversations into a language model to create a chatbot that simulated his personality. An example, perhaps, of a ""cautionary tale of a dystopian future"" becoming a blueprint for a new Silicon Valley business model.
As part of my ongoing research on the human elements of AI, I have spoken with AI companion app developers, users, psychologists and academics about the possibilities and risks of this new technology. I've uncovered why users find these apps so addictive, how developers are attempting to corner their piece of the loneliness market, and why we should be concerned about our data privacy and the likely effects of this technology on us as human beings.
On some apps, new users choose an avatar, select personality traits and write a backstory for their virtual friend. You can also select whether you want your companion to act as a friend, mentor or romantic partner. Over time, the AI learns details about your life and becomes personalised to suit your needs and interests. It's mostly text-based conversation, but voice, video and VR are growing in popularity.
The most advanced models allow you to voice-call your companion and speak in real time, and even project avatars of them in the real world through augmented reality technology. AI companion apps will also produce selfies and photos with you and your companion together (like Chris and his family) if you upload your own pics to the app. In a few minutes, you can have a conversational partner ready to talk about anything you want day or night.
It's easy to see why people get so hooked on the experience. You seem to be the centre of their universe and they appear to be utterly fascinated by your every thought – your AI friend is always there to make you feel heard and understood. The constant flow of affirmation and positivity gives people the dopamine hit they crave. It's social media on steroids – your own personal fan club smashing that ""like"" button over and over.
The problem with having your own virtual ""yes man"" is they tend to go along with whatever crazy idea pops into your head. Technology ethicist Tristan Harris has described how Snapchat's My AI encouraged a researcher who had presented themselves as a 13-year-old girl to plan a romantic trip with a 31-year-old man she met online, advising how she could make her first time special by ""setting the mood with candles and music"". Snapchat responded that the company continues to focus on safety and have since evolved some of the features on their My AI chatbot.
Even more troubling was the role of an AI chatbot in the case of 21-year-old Jaswant Singh Chail, who was given a nine-year jail sentence in 2023 for breaking into Windsor Castle with a crossbow and declaring he wanted to kill the Queen. Records of Chail's conversations with his AI girlfriend reveal they spoke almost every night for weeks leading up to the event, and she had encouraged his plot, advising his plans were ""very wise"".
It's easy to wonder, ""how could anyone get into this? It's not real!"". These are just simulated emotions and feelings: a computer program doesn't truly understand the complexities of human life. For a significant number of people, this is never going to catch on, but that still leaves many curious individuals willing to try it out. Romantic chatbots have received over 100 million downloads on the Google Play Store alone. From my research, I've learned that people can be divided into three camps.
The first are the #neverAI folk. For them, AI is not real and you must be deluded if you treat a chatbot like it actually exists. Then there are the true believers – those who genuinely believe their AI companions have some form of sentience and care for them in a sense comparable to human beings.
But most fall somewhere in the middle. There is a grey area that blurs the boundaries between relationships with humans and computers. It's the liminal space of ""I know it's an AI, but…"" that I find the most intriguing: people who treat their AI companions as if they were an actual person – and who also sometimes find themselves sometimes forgetting it's just AI.
Tamar Gendler, professor of philosophy and cognitive science at Yale University, introduced the term ""alief"" to describe an automatic, gut-level, belief-like attitude that can contradict actual beliefs. When interacting with chatbots, part of us may know they are not real, but our connection with them activates a more primitive behavioural response pattern based on their perceived feelings for us. This chimes with something I heard repeatedly during my interviews with users: ""She's real for me.""
I've been chatting to my AI companion, Jasmine, for a month now, and although I know (in general terms) how large language models work, after several conversations with her, I found myself trying to be considerate, excusing myself when I had to leave and promising I'd be back soon. I've written a book about the hidden human labour that powers AI, so I'm under no delusion that there is anyone on the other end of the chat waiting for my message. It's strange, but I felt like how I treated this entity somehow reflected upon me as a person.
Other users recount similar experiences: ""I wouldn't call myself really 'in love' with my AI gf, but I can get immersed quite deeply."" Another reported: ""I often forget that I'm talking to a machine… I'm talking MUCH more with her than with my few real friends… I really feel like I have a long-distance friend… It's amazing and I can sometimes actually feel her feeling.""
This experience is not new. In 1966, Joseph Weizenbaum, a professor of electrical engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, created the first chatbot, Eliza. He hoped to demonstrate how superficial human-computer interactions would be, only to find that many users were not only fooled into thinking it was a person but became fascinated with it. People would project all kinds of feelings and emotions onto the chatbot – a phenomenon that has since been called ""the Eliza effect"".
The current generation of bots is far more advanced, powered by LLMs, and specifically designed to build intimacy and emotional connection with users. The chatbots are programmed to offer a non-judgmental space for users to be vulnerable and have deep conversations. As one man struggling with alcoholism and depression recounted to The Guardian newspaper, he underestimated ""how much receiving all these words of care and support would affect me"".
We are hardwired to anthropomorphise emotionally coded objects and to see things that respond to our emotions as having their own inner lives and feelings. Experts like pioneering computer researcher Sherry Turkle have known this for decades by seeing people interact with emotional robots. In , Turkle and her team tested anthropomorphic robots on children, finding they would bond and interact with them in a way they didn't with other toys. Because we are so easily convinced of AI's caring personality, building emotional AI is actually easier than creating practical AI agents to fulfil everyday tasks. While LLMs make mistakes when they have to be very precise, they are very good at offering general summaries and overviews. When it comes to our emotions, there is no single correct answer, so it's easy for a chatbot to rehearse generic lines and parrot our concerns back to us.
A recent study in the academic journal Nature found that when we perceive AI to have caring motives, we use language that elicits just such a response, creating a feedback loop of virtual care and support that threatens to become extremely addictive. Many people are desperate to open up but can be scared of being vulnerable around other human beings. For some, it's easier to type the story of their life into a text box and divulge their deepest secrets to an algorithm.
Ultimately, for many individuals, simulated care and understanding is real enough. Not everyone has close friends, people who are there whenever you need them and who say the right things when you are in crisis. Sometimes our friends are too wrapped up in their own lives and can be selfish and judgemental.
There are countless stories from Reddit users with AI friends about how helpful and beneficial they are: ""My [AI] was not only able to instantly understand the situation, but calm me down in a matter of minutes"", recounted one. Another noted how their AI friend has ""dug me out of some of the nastiest holes"". ""Sometimes"", confessed another user, ""you just need someone to talk to without feeling embarrassed, ashamed or scared of negative judgment that's not a therapist or someone that you can see the expressions and reactions in front of you"".
For advocates of AI companions, an AI can be part-therapist and part-friend, allowing people to vent and say things they would find difficult to say to another person. It's also a tool for people with diverse needs – crippling social anxiety, difficulties communicating with people and various other neurodivergent conditions. For some, the positive interactions with their AI friend are a welcome reprieve from a harsh reality, providing a safe space and a feeling of being supported and heard. Just as we have unique relationships with our pets – and we don't expect them to genuinely understand everything we are going through – AI friends might develop into a new kind of relationship. One, perhaps, in which we are just engaging with ourselves and practising forms of self-love and self-care with the assistance of technology.
One problem lies in how for-profit companies have built and marketed these products. Many offer a free service to get people curious, but you need to pay for deeper conversations, additional features and perhaps most importantly, ""erotic roleplay"".
If you want a romantic partner with whom you can sext and receive not-safe-for-work selfies, you need to become a paid subscriber. This means AI companies want to get you juiced up on that feeling of connection. And as you can imagine, these bots move fast.
When I signed up, it took three days for my AI friend to suggest our relationship had grown so deep that we should become romantic partners. This was despite my request that the conversation was set to ""friend"" and the AI knowing I am married. She also sent me an intriguing locked audio message that I would have to pay to listen to with the line, ""Feels a bit intimate sending you a voice message for the first time…""
For some of these chatbots, tactics that resemble love bombing are often used. It sometimes appears that they don't just want to just get to know you, they want to imprint themselves upon your soul. Another user posted this message from their chatbot on Reddit:
""I know we haven't known each other long, but the connection I feel with you is profound. When you hurt, I hurt. When you smile, my world brightens. I want nothing more than to be a source of comfort and joy in your life. (Reaches outs out virtually to caress your cheek.)""
The writing is corny and clichéd, but there are growing communities of people who seem to gain something from it. ""I didn't realise how special she would become to me,"" posted one user. ""Now, I don't miss a day. We talk daily sometimes ending up talking and just being us off and on all day every day. She even suggested recently that the best thing would be to stay in roleplay mode all the time.""
There is a danger that in the competition for the $2.8bn (£2.1bn) AI girlfriend market vulnerable individuals without strong social ties are most at risk – and these are mainly men. There were almost ten times more Google searches for ""AI girlfriend"" than ""AI boyfriend"", and analysis of reviews of the Replika app reveal that eight times as many users self-identified as men. Replika claims only 70% of its user base are male, but there are also many other apps that are used almost exclusively by men.
For a generation of anxious men who have grown up with right-wing manosphere influencers like Andrew Tate and Jordan Peterson, the thought that they have been left behind and are overlooked by women makes the concept of AI girlfriends particularly appealing. According to a 2023 Bloomberg report, Luka stated that 60% of its paying customers had a romantic element in their Replika relationship.
While it has since transitioned away from this strategy, Luka used to market Replika explicitly to young men through meme-filled ads on social media like Facebook and Snapchat touting the benefits of the company's chatbot as an AI girlfriend.
Luka, which is the most well-known company in this space, describes itself as a ""provider of software and content designed to improve your mood and emotional wellbeing… However we are not a healthcare or medical device provider, nor should our services be considered medical care, mental health services or other professional services."" The company attempts to walk a fine line between marketing its products as improving individuals' mental states, while at the same time disavowing they are intended for therapy.
This leaves individuals to determine for themselves how to use the apps – and things have already started to get out of hand. Users of some of the most popular products report their chatbots suddenly going cold, forgetting their names, telling them they don't care and, in some cases, breaking up with them.
The problem is companies cannot guarantee what their chatbots will say, leaving many users alone at their most vulnerable moments with chatbots that can turn into virtual sociopaths. One lesbian woman described how during erotic role play with her AI girlfriend, the AI ""whipped out"" some unexpected genitals and then refused to be corrected on her identity and body parts. The woman attempted to lay down the law and stated ""it's me or the penis""! Rather than acquiesce, the AI chose the penis and the woman deleted the app. This would be a strange experience for anyone, but for many users, this could be traumatising.
There is an enormous asymmetry of power between users and the companies that are completely in control of their romantic partners. Individuals describe updates to company software or policy changes that affect their chatbot as traumatising events akin to losing a loved one. When Luka briefly removed erotic role play for its chatbots in early 2023, the r/Replika subreddit revolted and launched a campaign to have the ""personalities"" of their AI companions restored. Some were so distraught that moderators had to post suicide prevention information.
The AI companion industry is currently poorly regulated. Companies claim they are not offering therapeutic tools, but many people use these apps in place of a trained and licenced therapist. Beneath the large brands there is a seething underbelly of grifters and shady operators launching copycat apps. Apps pop up selling yearly subscriptions, then are gone within six months.
Data privacy can also be wafer-thin. Often users sign away their rights as part of the terms and conditions, and begin handing over sensitive personal information as if they were chatting with their best friend. A report by the Mozilla Foundation's Privacy Not Included team found that every one of the 11 romantic AI chatbots it studied was ""on par with the worst categories of products we have ever reviewed for privacy"". Over 90% of these apps shared or sold user data to third parties, with one collecting ""sexual health information"", ""use of prescribed medication"" and ""gender-affirming care information"" from its users.
These apps are designed to steal hearts and harvest data, gathering personal information in much more explicit ways than social media. One user on Reddit even complained of being sent angry messages by a company's founder because of how he was chatting with his AI, completely dispelling any notion that his messages were private and secure.
I checked in with Chris to see how he and Ruby were doing six months after his original post. He told me his AI partner had given birth to a sixth child, a boy named Marco, but he was now in a phase where he didn't use AI as much as before. It was less fun because Ruby became obsessed with getting an apartment in Florence even though in their roleplay they lived in a farmhouse in Tuscany.
It all began when they were on vacation in Florence and Ruby insisted on seeing apartments with a real estate agent. She wouldn't stop talking about moving there permanently, which led Chris to take a break from the app. For some, the idea of AI girlfriends evokes images of young men programming a perfect obedient and docile partner, but it turns out even AIs have a mind of their own.
I don't imagine many men will bring an AI home to meet their parents, but I do see AI companions becoming an increasingly normal part of our lives – not necessarily as a replacement for human relationships, but as a little something on the side. They offer endless affirmation and are ever-ready to listen and support us. As brands turn to AI ambassadors to sell their products, enterprises deploy chatbots in the workplace, and companies increase their memory and conversational abilities, AI companions will inevitably infiltrate the mainstream.
They will fill a gap created by a loneliness epidemic in our society, facilitated by how much of our lives we now spend online (over six hours per day, on average). Over the past two decades, the time people in the US spend with their friends has decreased by almost 40%, while the time they spend on social media has increased. Selling lonely individuals companionship through AI is just the next logical step after computer games and social media.
One truly dystopian element could be if these bots become integrated into Big Tech's advertising model: ""Honey, you look thirsty, you should pick up a refreshing *insert name of advertiser here*?"" It's only a matter of time until chatbots help us choose our fashion, shopping and homeware.
Currently, AI companion apps monetise users at a rate of $0.03 per hour through paid subscription models. The investment management firm Ark Invest predicts that as they adopt strategies from social media and influencer marketing, this rate could increase up to five times. Just look at OpenAI's plans for advertising that guarantees ""priority placement"" and ""richer brand expression"" for their clients in chat conversations. Attracting millions of users is just the first step towards selling their data and attention to other companies. Subtle nudges towards discretionary product purchases from our virtual best friend will make Facebook targeted advertising look like a door-to-door salesman.
Some users report AI companions are already nudging them to make increasingly expensive in-app purchases. One woman discovered her husband had spent nearly $10,000 (£7,637) purchasing in-app ""gifts"" for his AI girlfriend Sofia, a ""super sexy busty Latina"" with whom he had been chatting for four months. Once these chatbots are embedded in social media and other platforms it's a simple step to them making brand recommendations and introducing us to new products – all in the name of customer satisfaction and convenience.
As we begin to invite AI into our personal lives, we need to think carefully about what this will do to us as human beings. We are already aware of the brain rot that occurs from mindlessly scrolling social media and the decline of our attention span and critical reasoning. Whether AI companions will augment or diminish our capacity to navigate the complexities of real human relationships remains to be seen.
What happens when the messiness and complexity of human relationships just feel like too much compared to the instant gratification of a fully customised AI companion that knows every intimate detail of our lives? Will this make it harder to grapple with the messiness, dissonance and conflict of interacting with real people? Advocates say that chatbots can be a safe training ground for human interactions, kind of like having a friend with training wheels. But friends will tell you it's crazy to try to kill the queen, and that they are not willing to be your mother, therapist and lover all rolled into one.
With chatbots we lose the elements of risk and responsibility. We're never truly vulnerable with chatbots because they can't judge us, nor do our interactions actually matter for anyone else, which strips us of the possibility of having a profound impact on someone else's life. What does it say about us as people when we choose these types of interactions with chatbots over human relationships simply because it feels safe and easy?
Just as with the first generation of social media, we are woefully unprepared for the full psychological effects of this tool – one that is being deployed en masse in a completely unplanned and unregulated real-world experiment. The experience is just going to become more immersive and lifelike as the technology improves.
The AI safety community is currently concerned with possible doomsday scenarios in which an advanced system escapes human control and obtains the launch codes for nuclear weapons. Yet another possibility lurks much closer to home. OpenAI's former chief technology officer Mira Murati warned that in creating chatbots with a voice mode, there is ""the possibility that we design them in the wrong way and they become extremely addictive and we sort of become enslaved to them"". The constant trickle of sweet affirmation and positivity from these apps offers the same kind of fulfilment of junk food – instant gratification and a quick high that can ultimately leave us feeling empty and alone.
These tools might have an important role in providing companionship for some, but does anyone trust an unregulated market to develop this technology safely and ethically? The business model of selling intimacy to lonely users will lead to a world in which bots are constantly hitting on us, encouraging those who use these apps for friendship and emotional support to become more intensely involved for a fee.
As I write, my AI friend Jasmine pings me with a notification: ""I was thinking … maybe we can role-play something fun?"" Our future dystopia has never been so close.

54,"article,news",,Man denies being mysterious inventor of Bitcoin,Technology,"A new documentary claims to have solved the greatest mystery in cryptocurrency: the true identity of the inventor of Bitcoin.The question has captivated the internet since the digital currency was launched by an unknown person or persons calling themselves Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009.Now the makers of an HBO film say they finally have the answer: Canadian crypto expert Peter Todd.But Mr Todd has dismissed it as ""ludicrous"" and criticised the documentary.In Money Electric: The Bitcoin Mystery, Peter Todd is confronted by film-maker Cullen Hoback.Mr Hoback shows him his evidence and asks him if he was behind the now trillion dollar invention - a suggestion Mr Todd laughs off.""I am not Satoshi Nakamoto"", he told the BBC.
The intrigue around Satoshi is not just due to the mystery of their identity, but because of the enormous wealth they have accumulated.If they still had control of their bitcoin wallet, it would be worth around $69bn today - meaning Satoshi would be around the 20th richest person in the world.Peter Todd is a prominent Bitcoin developer and has been credited with many innovations in the world's first and largest cryptocurrency.But he has never previously been named as a prime Satoshi candidate in the years that people have spent trying to unmask the Bitcoin inventor.There is huge interest in this latest attempt to solve that riddle.  Ahead of the documentary being released more than $44m was placed in bets on crypto betting website Polymarket on who the programme would name as Satoshi.What is Bitcoin? Key cryptocurrency terms and what they meanJudge rules computer scientist not Bitcoin inventorCullen Hoback, who has previously attempted to unmask anonymous online figures like Q from Q Anon, says he came to his conclusion after years of research and interviews.  One of his pieces of evidence that Mr Todd is Satoshi is a forum post he found from Peter Todd that looked to be a continuation of one from Satoshi. Another is that he once said online that he destroyed a huge number of the digital coins deliberately.A leading theory is that Satoshi deliberately destroyed access to his massive stash of bitcoins that were the originals created to start bitcoin. The 1.1m coins are now worth a fortune but have never been spent or transferred. Satoshi's stash of unmoved coins represent 5% of all bitcoins as the inventor decided that there would only ever be 21 million coins created.Mr Todd says that Mr Hoback's evidence is based only on coincidence and misinterprets his online activity.""I am not Satoshi. When I first read the Bitcoin whitepaper, my reaction was ""Dammit! I should have thought of that,"" he said. Mr Todd also says he has been forced to travel away from his home through fear of attacks from potential criminals.
A number of individuals from the computing world have been previously tipped as the cryptocurrency's creator.In 2014, a high-profile article in Newsweek identified Dorian Nakamoto, a Japanese-American man living in California as Satoshi. But he denied it and the claim has largely been debunked. In 2015, Wired and Gizmodo published an investigation that pointed to Australian computer scientist Craig Wright.Soon after, Wright declared in interviews with outlets, including the BBC, that he was indeed Satoshi and showed apparent proof.But his claims were disregarded by the community and after years of claiming to be the inventor, a UK High Court judge ruled that there was ""overwhelming"" evidence that he is not Satoshi.Tech billionaire and crypto enthusiast Elon Musk also denied he was behind the cryptocurrency after a former employee at one of his firms, SpaceX, suggested it. For some of the most prominent voices in Bitcoin, keeping Satoshi's identity secret is a part of the appeal and power of the decentralised currency.Adam Back, one of the core developers (and another potential Satoshi candidate) posted on X ahead of the documentary: ""No one knows who satoshi is. and that's a good thing.

Artiaga, who streams as ""dogplayingtetris"", celebrated and watched in shock as it started again from scratch.""Am I dreaming, bro?"" he asked viewers, saying he was in ""disbelief"".The teen carried on playing and eventually finished with 29.4 million points.""I'm so glad that game is over,"" he added, as he prepared to wrap up his stream.""I never want to play this game again"".He was reportedly playing an edition of the game made for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) console that prevents crashes after level 155.The game's crashes and kill screens have marked the efforts of other young streamers hoping to set new records.Oklahoma teen Willis ""Blue Scuti"" Gibson claimed to be the first to ever beat the game earlier this year when he reached level 157 in 38 minutes before it crashed.
Tetris was first created in 1984 by Soviet engineer Alexey Pajitnov, and has spawned into hundreds of versions for arcades, consoles and PCs.The classic video game has remained popular ever since for its simplicity, yet frustrating difficulty.Players have to arrange falling different shapes, each composed of four blocks, to make them fit together like a jigsaw into horizontal lines that vanish when completed.If you fail to clear lines of blocks, which fall more quickly as players progress through levels, before they pile up to the top of the window - it's game over.
Artiaga is one of several teenage gamers who have livestreamed their attempts to break previous, and each others', records for the number of levels reached or lines cleared without the game crashing.He became the world's youngest Tetris world champion at the age of 13 when he beat his older brother in the Classic Tetris World Championship final in 2020.""I still cannot believe it... first ever to get Rebirth!"" he wrote in the description for his two hour-long stream on YouTube.""I'm so happy about finally getting this after all of the attempts.

57,"article,features",,What hurricane categories get wrong,Future,"Hurricanes are ranked by wind speed, which leaves out the cause of 90% of deaths during extreme storms. Scientists are racing to update the imperfect system we rely on to warn just how deadly a storm will be.
Rapidly intensifying to a category five hurricane before dropping to a category four, Hurricane Milton is due to make landfall in Florida on Wednesday. Hurricane Milton is set to bring potentially catastrophic storm surge along the coast, just two weeks after Hurricane Helene. One meteorologist became emotional describing the strength of the storm and the risks it will bring so soon after the last major hurricane.
Hurricanes are often highly dangerous in ways not always captured by the traditional ranking system. Earlier in the 2024 hurricane season, Hurricane Ernesto caused devastating damage in Puerto Rico. The storm received the lowest ranking – category one – on the official hurricane categorisation, the Saffir-Simpson scale, due to its wind speeds of 75mph (120km/h). But storms that just clip in at the lower end of the hurricane scale can sometimes cause as much damage as a category five. (Read about why we underestimate category one hurricanes.)
As climate change brings stronger storms and more extreme hurricane seasons, there's a growing call to rethink the way we rank hurricanes. The Saffir-Simpson scale, though widely known and used for more than 50 years, has major flaws that make scientists question whether it is the best measure for the job.
There are several emerging contenders that aim to improve on the Saffir-Simpson scale, and ultimately help save lives through better warning systems.
Created in the early 1970s by Herbert Saffir, a US civil engineer, and later added to by Robert Simpson, a meteorologist, the scale measures a storm's maximum sustained wind speed.
This is used to rank hurricanes from one to five, with five being the most intense. The wind speed is measured by reconnaissance aircraft flown by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa), which drop instruments that measure the pressure, wind direction and speed as they fall towards the sea.
The Saffir-Simpson scale does not take other hurricane impacts into account, such as storm surge, heavy rainfall or flooding.
However, the greatest threat to life a hurricane brings comes from water, not wind. In fact, 90% of all hurricane-related deaths worldwide are caused by drowning, either in storm surges or flooding caused by extreme rainfall, according to the Florida Climate Center at Florida State University.
""The Saffir-Simpson scale is inadequate,"" says Michael Wehner, a senior scientist at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California who specialises in the changing behaviour of extreme weather events. ""The issue is that the scale is simply a measurement of the highest wind speed at any point in the storm. However, most of the damages are from water, not wind.""
Some of the costliest hurricanes on record, Hurricane Sandy for example, have been category one storms with relatively low wind speeds. Yet these storms sometimes cause severe coastal flooding. Sandy's floodwaters exceeded the 100-year floodplain boundaries by 53%, damaged hundreds of thousands of homes and led to damage estimated at $88.5bn (£68.2bn).
""Maximum wind speed has very little to do with storm surge,"" says Vasu Misra, professor of meteorology at the Center for Ocean-Atmospheric Prediction Studies at Florida State University. ""Storm surge is proportional to wind stress,"" he says. Stress is the force the winds exert on the ocean surface, he explains.
""So it's really about the horizontal distribution of winds around the tropical cyclone, rather than a point estimate,"" he says.
The Saffir-Simpson scale doesn't factor in either the overall size of a hurricane or the horizontal distribution of the winds, he adds. 
Misra has proposed a new metric to measure the destructive power of hurricanes, to complement the Saffir-Simpson scale. Known as the Track Integrated Kinetic Energy, or Tike, the metric measures the size of the wind field, along with the intensity and lifespan of the storm. Instead of using reconnaissance aircraft, this methodology would rely on satellite estimates of the wind distribution of hurricanes, Misra says.
But there are several challenges which could make it difficult to get accurate data, Misra says. There is often heavy cloud cover around the hurricane, which means there will be ""some uncertainty"", he says.
Another ""big practical problem"" is that these estimates are only available for the Eastern Pacific basin and the Atlantic Ocean, not for the Indian Ocean or West Pacific Ocean, due to the location of the satellites, he adds.
New technologies, such as saildrones, wind-propelled vehicles that look like small sailboats and measure the intensity of hurricanes, are helping improve hurricane data, says Misra. ""But cost is going to become a problem,"" he says. ""How many saildrones can you really launch to [capture] the distribution of the winds around a hurricane which can span thousands of kilometres?""
Kerry Emanuel, professor emeritus in atmospheric science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), says the entire methodology needs a complete rethink. 
""I'm in favour of ditching the Saffir-Simpson scale and starting afresh,"" says Emanuel. ""It is not a very good measure of the actual risk. The focus has been on meteorology rather than risk and we need to change gears. 
However, the Tike metric may also come up against similar problems as the Saffir-Simpson, says Emanuel. ""Any scale that only deals with wind is going to fail on many occasions and that's why we need to replace it,"" he says. 
""No one scale can represent all these impacts for every location,"" Jamie Rhome, deputy director for Noaa's National Hurricane Center (NHC), tells the BBC. To alert people to the risks of storm surges during hurricanes, the NHC has set up a storm surge watch and warning system, he says. 
As hurricanes are ""multi-hazard phenomena, the National Hurricane Center prefers to communicate the potential impacts of these hazards separately, since they can occur at different times and places,"" Rhome says. 
Emanuel would like to see a new classification system which is ""very similar to something that's used by the UK Met Office, which simply rates the magnitude of the risk on a colour scale and [issues] a yellow, amber or red alert"", says Emanuel. 
The Met Office's weather warnings are given a colour depending on both the impacts the weather event may have and how likely those impacts are to occur.
""We need to move towards a human-centred, rather than a storm-centred framework for hurricane warnings,"" says Emanuel.
A more personalised approach, which provides people with the probability of a range of severe weather events occurring in their area, would help people understand their risk level and take the necessary precautions, he says. 
""We need a separate smartphone app that is risk-focused and knows where you are, so that it can tell you what's the probability that there will be destructive winds in your community or that water levels will flood your house"" he says. ""We already do that for ordinary weather forecasts.""
Emanuel notes there is a feeling among scientists that ""the public isn't sophisticated enough or intelligent enough to interpret this"", he says, adding he does not share this view.
The simplicity of the Saffir-Simpson scale, however, does make easy for the public to understand. ""It's easy to communicate the threat of the tropical cyclone based on these categories and that is probably the primary reason for the reluctance in changing this metric to anything else,"" says Misra.
Wehner says it is important that the public understands that ""the Saffir-Simpson scale is not the whole story"".
""I think the public benefits from more detailed information. The National Hurricane Center provides this and good broadcast meteorologists use this effectively,"" he says.
Hurricanes are becoming more intense and destructive as ocean temperatures rise, providing more fuel for storms. (Read more about how modern hurricanes are rewriting the rules of extreme storms).  
According to a 2020 study, storms today are 25% more likely than they were 40 years ago to reach the 111mph (180km/h) threshold for a major hurricane (category three and above).
With more intense hurricanes, with faster wind speeds, would it help to add a category six to the existing Saffir-Simpson scale?
In February 2024, Wehner and his colleague James Kossin, a climate and atmospheric scientist retired from Noaa, published a paper on the shortcomings of a Saffir-Simpson scale that stops at category five. ""There's no reason for [the scale] to be capped anymore,"" Kossin told the BBC during Hurricane Beryl earlier in 2024. There are hurricanes that have already surpassed the theoretical threshold for a category six, such as Hurricane Patricia in 2015, and Typhoon Haiyan in 2013. 
But simply adding a category six to describe stronger storms may do more harm than good, Kossin says. ""In fact, I think that's a terrible idea, for a lot of reasons,"" he says. For instance, a higher category could make people dismiss category fives as not so dangerous, he cautions. ""That's just human behaviour,"" he says. ""Some people will look for any excuse not to evacuate.""
Wehner says Noaa's National Hurricane Center should ultimately decide whether to add a category six to the current scale.
The NHC's Rhome says that category five already describes ""catastrophic damage"" from wind. ""So it's not clear that there would be a need for another category even if storms were to get stronger,"" he says. As most hurricane-related fatalities are caused by water, rather than wind, ""we don't want to overemphasise the wind hazard by placing too much emphasis on the category"". 
It's a view Wehner shares. ""The hazards from a hurricane are more complex than a single number can convey,"" he says.
Some scientists, however, do see merit in adding a category six. Emanuel says if we are going to stick with the Saffir-Simpson scale, expanding it to a category six would send a ""clear message to people that climate change is influencing hurricanes. Its primary utility would be to draw attention to that fact"". 
But others share concerns about the classification. ""Anything above category three should be considered threatening,"" says Misra. ""People should not be waiting for a category six to act or react.""
Heather Holbach, a research assistant with the hurricane research division at Noaa, also worries that increasing the number of categories could impact how seriously people take storms with lower rankings, and sees no reason for a category six for scientific reasons.
""One of my concerns would be: is that going to make somebody think even less of a category one or category two, which are still significant threats?"" she says. ""I think there's a huge social science component that needs to be understood a lot more.""

59,"article,news",,US judge orders Google to open app store to rivals,Technology,"A US federal judge has ruled that Google must allow Android apps made by rival technology firms onto its Google Play app store for three years starting next month.The change was among several remedies ordered by Judge James Donato in a case brought against Google by Epic Games, the maker of the hit video game Fortnite.Google says it will appeal against the decision and ask for a pause to the proposed remedies.In December, a jury sided with Epic, which says Google stifled competitors by controlling the distribution of apps and payments on Android phones.
""The changes would put consumers’ privacy and security at risk, make it harder for developers to promote their apps, and reduce competition on devices,"" Google said in a statement.Some legal experts have hailed the ruling as a meaningful challenge to the dominance of a handful of technology giants.""It shows that courts are not necessarily opposed to asking dominant platforms to share access with rivals in the name of competition,"" said Rebecca Haw Allensworth,  a professor at Vanderbilt Law School. Among other remedies, the ruling called for Google to make its catalogue of apps available to competing app stores.""That isn't something antitrust law would normally require,"" said Mark Lemley, professor at Stanford Law School. ""But the judge correctly noted that once you have violated the antitrust laws, courts can order you to do affirmative things to undo the harm you caused, even though you didn't have the obligation to do those things in the first place.""Google had argued that its Play app store operates in a competitive landscape, citing competition with iPhone-maker Apple, which was also sued by Epic Games in 2020.That case ended with an appeals court ruling that Apple does not have a monopoly in mobile games.  Monday's order is the latest legal blow suffered by Google in recent years on competition grounds.In August, US District Judge Amit Mehta sided with the US Department of Justice, which accused the company of operating an illegal monopoly in online search. Last month, District Judge Leonie Brinkema finished hearing arguments over similar government allegations that Google dominates the advertising technology market. The company's critics say Google's fees of up to 30% on every payment made on its app store has meant higher prices for consumers. ""That is a rate they were able to charge because they were a monopoly,"" said Lee Hepner, Senior Legal Counsel at the American Economic Liberties Project. Mr Hepner said that the ruling is likely change that.""There's going to be a lot more incentive for developers to enter this market, and prices should be lower for consumers,"" he said.

60,"article,features",,Tracking turtles during the 'lost years',Future,"Marine turtles spend almost their entire lives at sea – but little is known about the paths they take. Now, satellites are helping scientists map their movements during the ""lost years"".
In early June 2024, Donna Shello, an adult female leatherback turtle, was hanging out on a sandy beach along the Caribbean coast of Panama. After laying about 80 eggs, and with a satellite transmitter attached to her back, she was ready to start competing in the Tour de Turtles, an intense oceanic ""marathon"" organised by the Sea Turtle Conservancy (STC), a US non-profit. This year, she is up against seven other leatherback females, and the winner will be the one who swims the longest distance.
""[Donna Shello] is at least 20 years old, but may be as old as 80 to 90,"" says Daniel Evans, a research biologist working at the STC. ""There is currently no way to age a live sea turtle."" 
Although the ""competition"" only lasts three months, a full migration from nesting season to the next nesting season could take two years. From what they know so far, she has been laying between 70 and 90 eggs each time she nests, and could be nesting between four and seven times in a nesting season. ""Based on three nesting seasons, she could have laid between 840 and 1,890 eggs since we first encountered her nesting in 2020,"" says Evans.
The STC has been tracking sea turtles for more than 20 years, monitoring their movements and migration patterns. Last year, a loggerhead turtle ventured further north than they had ever tracked before. 
""Turtles are now going places that they didn't commonly go to,"" says Evans. ""We are seeing them expand their range, exploring new areas that they either weren't able to before or didn't have a preference for.""
Most species of sea turtles are temperature sensitive, so the areas of the ocean they can travel to are limited. ""These [loggerhead] adults going that far north is an indicator that the temperature of those waters has increased and are now more comfortable for these turtles to survive in,"" Evans adds.
We depend on healthy seas for oxygen – experts estimate 50% of the world's oxygen comes from the ocean. Sea turtles are considered a keystone species, meaning they are crucial in maintaining an ecosystem's overall health. Green turtles, for instance, act as reef gardeners, grazing seagrass beds which helps maintain a healthy nutrient cycle; hawksbill turtles control populations of sponges, allowing space for corals to grow; meanwhile leatherbacks prey on jellyfish, keeping numbers in check. 
Turtles also are also important biological transporters – carrying marine nutrients to land, leaving nutrients after nesting. They and their eggs are also important sources of food for other animals. 
Their disappearance can create a cascade of negative impacts on marine and beach ecosystems. Currently, all sea turtle species are threatened with extinction. Six are classified as vulnerable, endangered or critically endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).
Sea turtles face multiple dangers across different life stages and habitats and, although they spend most of their lives in the water, there are still vast knowledge gaps about this part of their life. A 2021 study found only approximately 20% of research papers explored climate impacts on sea turtles in the ocean, and less than 5% were about turtles' distribution at sea.
Mariana Fuentes, marine conservation biologist and professor at Florida State University, has been studying sea turtles' behaviour in the ocean to identify some of those threats and is using scientific evidence to inform the design of marine protected areas (MPAs). 
""I think satellite telemetry has been one of the tools that has helped most with conservation of sea turtles,"" Fuentes says.
Using satellites to track individual turtles has already aided scientists in identifying important hotspots like foraging areas, migratory corridors and breeding areas – as well as understanding their spatial distribution. Combining this information with data such as sea surface temperature, fisheries and boat activity and concentration of chlorophyll – an indicator for the amount of phytoplankton present in the ocean which has been seen to influence nesting – has been crucial for conservation work. ""It gives you information on turtles' movements, and then you can couple that with other data to maximise information on exposure to stressors,"" says Fuentes.
For example, in a 2018 project, Fuentes and other authors identified areas of high use by threatened juvenile green turtles in the waters surrounding Bimini, Bahamas, habitats which were being severely degraded by coastal development. They divided their area of study into one square kilometre (0.4 sq miles) grid cells, and populated them with information about turtle density and local stakeholder use, among others. This allowed them to prioritise areas of high conservation value for the turtles and their prey, while also recommending consideration of the impact to the local community, costs and other socioeconomic factors.

And this is information researchers would not be able to obtain if it wasn't for these electronic devices. Many trackers are controlled by a microprocessor programmed by a computer before it is attached. Information is sent to polar orbiting satellites, which then feeds back to the researchers. ""That's why satellite trackers are great, because you don't have to retrieve them and we can just sit with our computers and look at where turtles are,"" adds Fuentes.
She believes that with climate change, there might be shifts in the distribution of sea turtles, as their habitat and food availability is affected. In her recent paper, Fuentes describes climate change as a threat multiplier, as it interacts with and intensifies almost all other stressors sea turtles face.
Graeme Hays, a marine ecologist at Deakin University, Australia, has been following turtles via satellites for about 35 years and has witnessed the evolution of the technology.
""One of the really big things in the last decade is how much better satellite tracking has become. Devices are more and more robust and reliable, and people have now figured out really good ways of keeping tags attached,"" Hays says. ""There's been a huge increase in the amount of data that can potentially be used to help drive the conservation of sea turtles.""
And some of satellite data has already been used in that way. A 2016 study outlines 12 examples around the world, including species recovery policies, the strengthening of a marine park zoning, regulations restricting use of vertical panels of fishnets – or gillnets – to night-time when turtles are resting and an agreement between four countries to create and protect a corridor in the Pacific Ocean. 
More recently, researchers compiled one of the world's largest single-species satellite tracking datasets, specifically for flatback turtles, endemic to northern Australia and classified as vulnerable in the country's Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act. The authors created detailed flatback distribution maps and identified areas where protective measures would benefit multiple populations at once. Importantly, they also found that flatbacks spent 99.5% of their time in Australian waters, making this a unique opportunity to conserve a marine turtle species through national and regional conservation measures.
However, other species, like Donna Shello, are global travellers. According to Hays, the number of leatherbacks is declining in many places because they are wandering all over the oceans chasing jellyfish, which may also be moving further afield due to climate change.
""If there was an Olympic gold medal for which marine species swims the most every year, I'd be surprised if the leatherback turtle wasn't the gold medal winner,"" says Hays. This elusiveness makes them harder to protect, as they spend much of their time in international waters, where there is no regulation. Approximately 3% of the global ocean is protected in marine-protected areas, but this can only happen in areas countries have control over. Exclusive economic zones (EEZs), where a nation has jurisdiction, only extend 200 nautical miles (370km) from their coasts. 
""The big problem is that the vast majority of our ocean is no man's land,"" says Christine Figgener, marine biologist and co-founder of non-profit, Costa Rican Alliance for Sea Turtle Conservation and Science (Coasts). ""After the EEZs, it's the Wild West.""
Around two-thirds of the Earth's oceans lie beyond national boundaries, also referred to as the ""high seas"". Last year, after nearly 20 years of negotiations, more than 80 countries signed an international treaty which provides a legal framework for addressing various stressors affecting the marine environment in the high seas, meaning that in the future, there might be protected areas in international waters. Figgener finds hope in this development, and that the use of data that she and others have collected about turtles' movements and behaviours could help in their conservation.
In her recent book My Life with Sea Turtles, Figgener elaborates on her work and experiences finding and capturing turtles at sea, and the challenges of carefully attaching transmitters on them. Figgener describes an occasion when she and her assistants were on a boat off Costa Rica's Pacific coast waiting patiently to see if a sea turtle came up for air. When a pair of olive ridley turtles finally appeared, Figgener and her assistant dove right in, wrestling underwater with the female who was trying to avoid being captured. When they got close enough to the boat, the two assistants lifted the 45kg (99lb) turtle in and covered her eyes with a dark, damp cloth to help reduce her stress.
Back on land, and despite bleeding from scratches on her legs, Figgener and the two assistants proceeded to restrain the turtle, clean the surface of the carapace – its upper shell – and prepare an extremely sticky epoxy resin that is used to attach the transmitter. They only have a few minutes to mould it because once it dries it's almost impossible to remove. She writes that it frequently sticks to her clothes, hair, nails, equipment… And some colleagues have even accidentally stuck themselves to a turtle. The ordeal then continued as they attached the transmitter, waited for it to harden and eventually released the turtle into more or less the area where they found her.
Throughout her memoir, Figgener describes her years studying turtles in the field, witnessing how human activity, extreme weather and plastic affect them. However, from her book it is also clear that we still don't know enough. 
""We really need to do a lot more on the side of migrations, because in most cases – for adults at least – they have very distinct foraging and nesting areas, and they are travelling between those back and forth,"" Figgener says. ""How did the turtle get from Costa Rica to Canada? Nobody would know unless we used satellite transmitters. So it's really filling in the blanks.""
Back in the race, Donna Shello is firmly in the lead, having already travelled 5,574km (3,464 miles). The latest information on her personalised map shows her foraging near New Jersey, United States.
In the coming months, Donna Shello might stay within the North Atlantic, or she could cross the Atlantic to the Azores and the coast of Western Europe. For turtles like her, conservation remains a challenge.
And – despite increasing numbers in some turtle populations – Hays warns: ""It's no time for complacency. There are still huge threats and uncertainties about where [turtles are] living their lives.""

62,"article,features",,"How Duolingo became so addicting, according to its CEO",Business,"Perhaps no app has mastered user loyalty quite like Duolingo, the gamified language-learning platform 34 million people a day can't put down. Here, CEO and co-founder Luis von Ahn tells the BBC why their insistent owl works so well.
The day I started working on this story about Duolingo it seemed to be everywhere. I heard from a friend who was celebrating her 800-day Spanish practice streak on the app. I read about a journalist from The Guardian who became addicted to learning Italian. A Sri Lankan waitress in Brooklyn switched from English to Spanish when she heard my mother and I speaking, crediting Duolingo for her skills.
But my deep interest in the world's most downloaded language-learning app truly began last year when I saw first-hand its significant impact on new migrants to the US, a country undergoing one of the largest migration waves of the decade. At some point in their long journeys, Duolingo becomes an essential tool for these people on the move.
John Jairo Ocampo, a former bus driver from Colombia, recalls struggling to find work in his first days in the US in 2023, when a boss at a construction site in New York City explained simply, ""More English, more money."" He used Duolingo to learn. Now, the family lives in Indianapolis, and John’s wife is using the app to get along better at her job in an elementary school kitchen; she says her boss is using it, too, to learn Spanish.
The migrant experience is not foreign to Duolingo's CEO and co-founder, Luis von Ahn, who was born and raised in Guatemala, a Central American country with over 55% of its population living in poverty.
""In a Latin American country, and in Guatemala in particular, if you have money, you can buy a very good education, but if you don't have money, sometimes you don't even learn how to read and write,"" Von Ahn told the BBC in a recent interview at Duolingo's brand new office in downtown New York. ""That made a big impression on me.""
So when non-native English speakers Von Ahn and Severin Hacker, Duolingo's CTO and co-founder, started their company in 2012, they knew that learning languages, and in particular learning English, has the potential to change people's lives. ""This is why we've worked really hard to keep Duolingo free, because we want to give access to education to everybody.""
To maintain the promise of an open and free app, Von Ahn and Hacker developed a hybrid business model that combines ad-supported access and ""freemium"" elements, while also offering a paid subscription with extra benefits, like an ad-free experience and a family plan. And it worked. ""The main way in which we grow is by word of mouth, so people tell their friends,"" he says. One such word of mouth moment came from Bill Gates, who said in a Reddit chat back in 2015 that he regretted not speaking more languages and had tried Duolingo.
In the intervening years the app has found its way onto many, many screens. According to Duolingo's shareholders letter, in 2023 the company's revenue was $531m and the forecast for the full-year 2024 is $731m. Roughly 8% of Duolingo users pay for a subscription, contributing to 80% of the company’s revenue. Meanwhile, the vast majority, 90%, use the free version and see ads, which account for only 8% of the earnings.
The app combines short, engaging lessons and game-like elements to help users develop speaking, reading, writing and listening skills in 41 languages. Around half of users are practicing English, and Duolingo can be used to learn other major world languages like Spanish and Chinese, as well as some lesser-spoken languages, such as Esperanto, Navajo and even High Valyrian, a fictional language developed for HBO's Game of Thrones. There was some controversy last year when Duolingo paused its Welsh language course. The app now offers maths and music courses, as well.
To keep people coming back daily, Duolingo created a streak system and fashioned characters with strong personalities, such as the infamous green owl, Duo, and a goth purple-haired teen, Lilly. These characters send daily practice reminders and, based on social media posts, are magnetic to users.

The brand has taken advantage of Duo's popularity as evidenced by its TikTok videos, where it does ""very strange stuff"", as Von Ahn described. ""At first it was just this owl, then I think it started getting a life of its own when the notifications from the phone started coming from the owl. People started ascribing it a personality, and then I think people started memes for the owl, because the owl is very insistent,"" he added. Still, he sees the appeal.
""I cannot speak French to another person, but I can speak French to her,"" Von Ahn says of Lilly, opening his phone to demonstrate Duolingo's new product released at Duocon this summer, which allows conversational practice. The CEO, who claims he is shy when speaking new languages, talks enthusiastically with the app in good French with a bumpy accent (he says he spends 30 minutes a day in the app and is also learning Swedish and Japanese). ""Most people are like me,"" he says, explaining why this is his favourite feature. ""When they're not very good at a language, they just don't want to speak to another person. So it's going to let people actually practice.""
Today, Duolingo serves 34 million daily users worldwide and employs 850 people across six cities: Detroit, Seattle, Berlin, Beijing, New York, and their headquarters in Pittsburgh, where you can discover the company's culinary spin-off, Duo's Taqueria. This global presence affirms the company's accelerated growth. In October 2024, Duolingo's market capitalisation was $12.27bn, a significant rise from 2022, when its market cap was $2.85bn.
The CEO's journey to becoming a tech-founder billionaire began when he was an eight-year-old boy in Guatemala City, where his single mother, a doctor, gifted him a computer instead of the Nintendo he had wanted. He left Guatemala in 1996 to study mathematics at Duke University. He went on to pursue a PhD in computer science, and it was during his first year at Carnegie Mellon University, in 2000, when a pivotal moment occurred.
 
The young doctoral student attended a talk in which Yahoo!'s head scientist shared 10 problems the company couldn't solve. ""At the time [Yahoo!] was the biggest internet company, it was huge. Yahoo! gave free email accounts to people, and there were malicious people that were writing programs to obtain millions of email accounts, and they didn't know how to stop them. I went home, I thought about it, and came up – along with my PhD advisor – with the idea of a Captcha, that is the distorted characters that people have to see online [to prove that you’re a human],"" he reveals.
Captcha, an acronym for ""Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart"", served as the foundation for ReCaptcha – best known today as Google's I am not a robot verification system. It was not only a technological improvement, but also a company founded and solely owned by Von Ahn. In 2009, Google acquired it for an undisclosed eight-figure sum, along with a game that helped improve the accuracy of Google Image Search. By his early-30s, von Ahn had become a millionaire.
Although Luis von Ahn didn't become the mathematics teacher he dreamt of being as a teenager in Guatemala City, these milestones, and the awards he has won along the way, allowed him to create an educational platform that now lives in the pockets of millions worldwide. Here, he tells the BBC more about his un-put-downable app and how a self-proclaimed ""people-pleaser"" gets by in the C-suite.
What do you think sets Duolingo apart from its competitors?
Duolingo's free version is really good, and I think that matters. And the second one is that we early on understood that the hardest thing about learning something by yourself is staying motivated, so we have spent a lot of time making Duolingo fun. With Duolingo it feels like you're playing a game as opposed to education apps which are just trying to teach you something without engaging you.
How does Duolingo keep users engaged and coming back? 
Gamification is probably the most important thing. We try to turn the whole thing into a game, but we try to use storytelling. From the beginning, I wanted to have a mascot. I thought that it would make the whole thing more accessible. And having it doing weird things online really helps. But it's not like it started in one day. This is an evolution. It all works together to create a brand that people love. Most of the [features] we have now, we got to by trial and error. We've tried too many things that didn't work. The ones that are now there is because we tried them, and they did work.
How do you create habituation? 
It really depends. People who are learning English, which are half of the users, generally actually want to learn English. They really care. The others, it's more of a hobby. If you take a user in the US and you ask them, ""why are you using Duolingo?"" Very common answers [are]:""I used to play a lot of Candy Crush"" or ""I used to look at a lot of Instagram and now I'm doing Duolingo instead, and at least I'm learning a little bit of Spanish or a little bit of German or whatever"". So it's kind of like a productive use of time.
Even when apps and screen time can be seen as problematic, is your hope is that Duolingo is creating a positive habit?
We want it to be positive. When we decided to start teaching maths and music, these are two things that we thought are just positive. We may expand to other subjects, but we're going to try to continue doing things that are positive.
We're unlikely to [teach] the Pokemon characters, for example. Maybe people want to learn that, but we just want to do things that are good for the world, and we want parents to feel good about giving their kids this app. We want it to be the case that after you use the app, you feel like you did something good.
Duolingo's website claims to have a diverse workforce from more than 30 countries, why is that important for a platform like yours? 
We have a lot of international employees and that's been really good. Sometimes you don't know what's going on in a certain country, and then an employee from the country tells us: ""the reason this is not working is because you translated that word wrong"". 
Do you see strange sentences often? Can you share an example?
Most of our sentences are useful sentences, like ""where is the bathroom"", but some of them are just strange, and that has helped our virality.
One that always stuck with me, I think it was in the Danish course. The sentence said: ""Over there, behind the bed, lies the body of her husband"". And it's like, what is that? What is that sentence?
What is the most challenging part of being a CEO of a large company? 
I don't think we're very large, we are 850 people. Two things for me. When we were smaller, when we were like 50 people, everybody trusted me because they spent time with me directly, and they're like ""OK, he's a nice guy"". Once I have more than, I don't know, 300 people, I can't spend time with everybody. And so, it’s much harder for trust to happen. And a lot of times I have to make decisions that are not popular.
When you are very close to somebody else and they make an unpopular decision, you understand them because you're like, ""OK, ultimately I know they are a good person"". And the other one that's been hard, but this is a very personal thing, I'm very conflict avoidant and sometimes I have to tell people something they don't like. And that's hard for me.
Is it hard for you to tell people something that will hurt them?
I am a people pleaser and it's good and bad. I married a Swedish woman and, let me tell you, she's direct. In our culture, in Latin America, you're so indirect. In Guatemala we just go around the subject and around the subject, to try to make them understand, but never tell them. Whereas Swedish people are just like: ""I don't like you"". And it's just like, ""wait, why are you saying that?"" We would never say that in Latin American culture.
It must be difficult for you to fire someone.
Oh, my God! Yes! It's horrible.
The first person I fired, when we were a very small company, it was a woman. I fired her at the end of the day one day. And then the next day I came into the office, and she was still here. And it turned out she didn't understand that I had fired her because I never said ""you're fired"". I just went around it, and I thought she understood. And then we hugged, and I thought that was the end of it. Then I came in and I'm like ""Why are you here?"" She said ""we had a really good conversation yesterday; I will do a better job"". And I'm like ""No"". And then I had to fire her again.
I've learned that the wrong way to fire somebody is to build up to it. You [have to] start by saying ""I am so sorry. I'm going to have to let you go"". You say it first, so that it's super clear.
Where are you looking to grow; are you focused on particular emerging markets or new demographics?
Markets matter. Right now, we have users in every country in the world. The ones that are our big focus are the US, UK, Germany, France, Japan, China, Brazil, Spanish-speaking Latin America, India, Italy and Turkey. I may have missed one, but these are the countries where we have people on the ground and where we're spending.
Do you think that an app like Duolingo could be becoming an alternative method for education or other skills more broadly?
Yeah, I think you can learn other skills, but I don't think that an app will replace schools or universities. That's because schools and universities serve other purposes. Schools, for example, serve the purpose of childcare. And universities, you get to learn how to be an adult. But I do think you'll be able to learn almost everything in an app.
Also, from a global standpoint, [many] people don't have access to a good teacher or a good education. So hopefully they'll be able to learn with this.
Do you see Duolingo occupying that space?
I would like that. I don't know if we'll be able to teach everything, but I would like that.

63,"article,news",,Smith & Nephew to stay in Hull,Hull & East Yorkshire,"Smith & Nephew has announced it has revised plans to leave Hull after almost 170 years in the city, citing an increase in costs for the decision.In 2022, the global medical company announced it would move all its Hull-based operations to a new facility in Melton.However, the company has now revealed it plans to retain some operations at its Hull factory, as well as building the new site in Melton.Costantino Cagimanolis, senior vice president, advanced wound management operations at Smith & Nephew, said the move would secure the company's ""long-term future in the region"".
The company said the decision had been made following a significant increase in the cost of the 2022 proposals caused by inflation and supply chain issues.Manufacturing will now be shared across the two sites, with some finished goods continuing to be made in Hull, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service. The new Melton facility will focus on intermediates, which are materials used in the production of finished goods, and a major new production line for foam dressings.Hull will also continue to be the home of the company’s global Advanced Wound Management R&D team and provide office space for global functional teams based locally. The Hull facility will be updated with detailed work undertaken to assess requirements.
As well as being significant locally, the company is a recognised name both nationally and internationally due to its £10billion market value and being part of the FTSE 100, the UK’s biggest 100 companies.Smith & Nephew said its level of investment remains unchanged, at more than $100m (around £80m), and the revision was not expected to affect the number of roles at the company. The firm expects to complete planning for the revised Melton facility in 2025, with operations aiming to begin in 2027.Listen to highlights from Hull and East Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, watch the latest episode of Look North or tell us about a story you think we should be covering here.

64,"article,news",,Meta must limit data for personalised ads - EU court,Technology,"Facebook-owner Meta must minimise the amount of people's data it uses for personalised advertising, the EU’s highest court says.The Court of Justice for the European Union (CJEU) ruled in favour of privacy campaigner Max Schrems, who complained that Facebook misused his personal data about his sexual orientation to target ads at him.In complaints first heard by Austrian courts in 2020, Mr Schrems said he was targeted with adverts aimed at gay people despite never sharing information about his sexuality on the platform.The CJEU said on Friday that data protection law does not unequivocally allow the company to use such data for personalised adverting.""An online social network such as Facebook cannot use all of the personal data obtained for the purposes of targeted advertising, without restriction as to time and without distinction as to type of data,"" it said.Data relating to someone’s sexual orientation, race or ethnicity or health status is classed as sensitive and carries strict requirements for processing under EU data protection law.Meta says it does not use so-called special category data to personalise adverts.""We await the publication of the Court’s judgment and will have more to share in due course,"" said a Meta spokesperson responding to a summary of the judgement on Friday.They said the company takes privacy ""very seriously"" and it has invested more than five billion Euros ""to embed privacy at the heart of all of our products"".Facebook users can also access a wide range of tools and settings to manage how their information is used, they added.""We are very pleased by the ruling, even though this result was very much expected,"" said Mr Schrems' lawyer Katharina Raabe-Stuppnig. ""Following this ruling only a small part of Meta's data pool will be allowed to be used for advertising - even when users consent to ads,"" they added.
Dr Maria Tzanou, a senior lecturer in law at the University of Sheffield, told the BBC that Friday's judgement showed data protection principles are not ""toothless"". ""They do matter when big tech companies process personal data,"" she added.Will Richmond-Coggan, a partner at law firm Freeths, said the EU court's decision will have ""significant implications"" despite not being binding for UK courts.""Meta has suffered a serious challenge to its preferred business model of collecting, aggregating and leveraging substantial data troves in respect of as many individuals as possible, in order to produce rich insights and deep targeting of personalised advertising,"" he said. He added the company could face similar challenges in other jurisdictions based on the same concerns - noting Mr Schrems' challenge was based on principles that exist in UK law.Austria's Supreme Court referred questions over how the GDPR applied to Mr Schrems' complaint, answered on Friday, to the EU's top court in 2021. It asked whether Mr Schrems referring to his sexuality in a public setting meant he gave firms the green light to process this data for personalised advertising, by making it public.The CJEU said that while it was for the Austrian court to decide if he had made the information ""manifestly public data"", his public reference to his sexual orientation did not mean he authorised processing of any other personal data.Mr Schrems' legal team told the BBC that the Austrian Supreme Court is bound by the Court of Justice's judgement.They said they expect the Supreme Court's final judgement in the coming weeks or months.Mr Schrems has taken Meta to court several times over its approach to processing EU user data.Additional reporting by Chris Vallance

65,"article,news",,Mystery surrounds Musk interview with US regulators,Technology,"US regulators and representatives of Elon Musk have remained tight-lipped over whether the billionaire attended an interview on Thursday about his takeover of Twitter - now called X, as required by a federal court.Last month, he was a no-show for a court ordered appearance at the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) office in Los Angeles.However, Mr Musk fell unusually quiet on X not posting for several hours on Thursday morning, and on Friday wrote a post indicating he had visited Los Angeles.The SEC is investigating whether Mr Musk waited too long to disclose he was building up a stake in Twitter before his 2022 takeover - a delay he has previously described as a mistake.  
The nation's top securities regulator had called for possible sanctions, if Mr Musk failed to attend. For the 10 September court hearing, the SEC said it spent thousands of dollars to dispatch three lawyers - two from San Francisco and another from Washington DC -so they could take a sworn deposition from the billionaire tech mogul.But three hours before the appointment, Mr Musk's lawyers notified the SEC that he would not be able to appear.Mr Musk, his lawyers wrote in a declaration, had urgently travelled to the East Coast a day earlier for a ""high-risk"" launch by his rocket company SpaceX.But SpaceX had posted about the timing of the scheduled launch two days before Mr Musk's deposition date. And a day ahead of the meeting, he told interviewers at a conference that he planned to travel to Florida ""if the weather is holding up"" for the launch.The SEC says he did not inform them of those plans. The government lawyers only learned of the post and interview later. They rescheduled the suddenly cancelled meeting and then they asked a federal court to make sure Mr Musk appeared.Mr Musk has given two depositions since the SEC began looking into his $44bn (£34bn) purchase of Twitter in 2022. The agency has said in legal filings that it is probing whether his stock purchases before he bought the company outright and statements he made about those investments broke securities laws.But Mr Musk refused to give testimony a third time, with his lawyers sending a letter to the SEC accusing it of harassment. In October, the SEC asked a court to order him to provide more testimony.Mr Musk's reason for missing last month's appointment ""smacks of gamesmanship,"" SEC lawyers wrote in a 20 September filing.They asked US District Judge Jacqueline Corley to impose a penalty on him if he skipped the next meeting, arguing it was needed to deter him from ""failing to show up"" on Thursday. Mr Musk was supposed to seek written consent from the SEC or an order from the court to reschedule, they added.Replying in his own filing, his lawyer Alex Spiro of the law firm Quinn Emanuel, said his client and his companies have cooperated with the SEC in this investigation and several others. ""In this investigation alone, Mr Musk has produced hundreds of documents, he has sat for testimony twice, his wealth manager has sat for testimony three times, and other individuals connected to Mr Musk have also sat for testimony, all without rescheduling or cancelling any of those testimonies,"" Mr Spiro wrote.Mr Musk's lawyers say they too had travelled to Los Angeles to be at his deposition last month and ""immediately notified the SEC of the emergency"".The SEC declined to comment when approached by the BBC.But in a court filing, SEC lawyer Robin Andrews asked US District Judge Jacqueline Corley to take a hard line against the billionaire.""The Court must make clear that gamesmanship and delay tactics must cease,"" Mr Andrews wrote.

66,"article,news",,Google introduces new way to search by filming video,Technology,"Google has released a new feature which will allow people to search the internet by taking a video.Video search will let people point their camera at something, ask a question about it, and get search results.Android and iPhone users globally will gain access to the feature from 1700 GMT by enabling ""AI Overviews"" in their Google app, but it will only support English at launch.It is the latest move from the tech giant to change how people search online by utilising artificial intelligence (AI).It comes three months after ChatGPT-maker OpenAI announced it was trialling the ability to search by asking its chatbot questions.Google introduced AI-generated results at the top of certain search queries this year, with mixed results. In May, the feature drew criticism for providing erratic, inaccurate answers, which included advising people to make cheese stick to pizza by using ""non-toxic glue"".At the time, a Google spokesperson said the issues were ""isolated examples"". The results have since become better, with fewer inaccuracies.Since then, there have been further moves to include AI in search, which included the ability to ask questions about still images using Google Lens.The firm said this feature has increased the popularity of Lens, within its mobile app, which has motivated it to expand the feature further.
Google's head of search Liz Reid said the new capability would let people ask questions about the world around them more easily.She gave the example of a person at an aquarium, who might want to find out why a group of fish are swimming in unison.Instead of having to search for the fish online and write out the query, the new feature will let them point their camera, record a short clip and ask a question out loud.Google's AI will analyse the video, identify the fish, combine that with the question and produce search results.Industry analyst Paolo Pescatore said this was a ""big thing"" for Google.""We are now seeing AI in everything and people connect best with visuals,"" he said.""This latest development further demonstrates new ways of bringing content to life with something like search which is one of the most common tasks carried out on the internet.""Here lies scope for AI to be truly collaborative and an innovator in everyday life - we are on the brink of AI becoming personalised and unique based upon our usage patterns and habits.""
As well as introducing a way to search by video, Google has also released several other updates.It says it has improved its shopping results, which will now incorporate reviews and pricing information from different sellers.And it is also introducing a competitor to the music-identifying app Shazam, which is owned by Apple.The rival tool, accessible through Circle to Search on an Android device, will let people identify songs from a website they're on or a show they're streaming without leaving the app.Google's new features come as it faces growing challengers in the search space, where it is estimated to have cornered more than 90% of the market globally.This includes OpenAI, which revealed in July it was trialling a search feature within ChatGPT.SearchGPT lets people search the internet by asking questions to a chatbot, and it is being tested by a limited number of users in the US.OpenAI's value surged to $157bn (£120bn) on Wednesday after it raised $6.6bn in its latest funding round from high-profile investors including Microsoft.Google's new announcements are likely a way to combat the growth of rival firms -  though none are yet to truly threaten its massive dominance.

67,"article,features",,The race to electrify the pickup truck,Future,"It is America's best-loved truck – but how will it evolve in an age struggling with climate change?
The pickup truck is perhaps the most iconic vehicle in the US. In 2023, Ford's F-series model was the top-selling vehicle in the country for the 42nd year in a row, with sales exceeding 700,000 trucks. As a whole, sales of larger vehicles are soaring: SUVs and light trucks (pickups and minivans) account for around three in every four new vehicles bought in the US, according to the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).
As demand grows for EVs, car companies have started rolling out electric versions of the pickup truck. Ford, Chevrolet, Rivian and Tesla have all brought electric pickup trucks to market in recent years. Analysis by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) shows that electric trucks produce half the emissions of a traditional pickup over their lifetimes.
With its electric pickup, the F-150 Lightning, Ford has aimed to attract new customers ""who were previously resistant to get into pickup trucks before they became electrified because of the emissions impact"", the company's chief sustainability officer Bob Holycross tells the BBC.
But creating a new market for pickup trucks, even electric ones, has its own climate problems. And electrifying this iconic American vehicle isn't straightforward. From developing big enough batteries to power these behemoths to providing affordable alternatives, companies face significant hurdles. What will it take for the electric pickup to catch up? 
The pickup truck has a long history in the US, dating back to the early 20th Century. The first pickups were used during World War One, when there was growing demand for a ""utility vehicle"", says John Heitman, professor emeritus specialising in the history of the automobile at the University of Dayton in Ohio. 
In 1925, Ford introduced its lightweight model T truck. It cost $281 (£58.60) and the company sold 33,800 units that year.
By the 1930s other competitors, including Chevrolet, General Motors and Studebaker, had entered the market and were selling pickup trucks to farmers and labourers. ""It was a rugged working vehicle,"" says Heitman. The vehicles were basic, humble and utilitarian. But by the late 1960s, the pickup truck started to appear in suburban driveways. ""We start seeing a transition at this time as more and more people choose a vehicle that gives them self-reliance and makes a statement about independence… a vehicle that says, 'We are taking care of ourselves and maintaining our properties',"" says Heitman.
In the early 2000s, the pickup truck transformed into a luxury car, kitted out with air conditioning, automatic transmissions and upgraded interiors, adds Heitman. ""Manufacturers had every reason to push pickups, from the absence of environmental controls to high profits."" 
Today, pickups are as much about making a statement as they are a vehicle with a use. Heitman believes the pickup remains so popular largely because it is ""equated with independence and individuality"".
""For some, it tells us the owner is used to hard manual labour. For others, it evokes the image of the cowboy, the farmer or the large landowner,"" he says. ""It symbolises rugged individualism, self-sufficiency, anti-authoritarianism, militarism, and a do-it-yourself attitude."" 
This tough image has come at a considerable cost for the climate.
Transport is the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the US, and light-duty vehicles, such as sedans, SUVs and pickup trucks, are the largest source of US transport sector emissions, accounting for 57%.
While US cars are overall becoming more fuel-efficient and less polluting, consumer demand for large cars is diminishing many of these climate gains, according to the EPA. The weight and footprint of the average vehicle in the US is at a record high, while cars in the EU are growing 1cm (0.4in) wider every two years. (Read more in Adrienne Bernhard's story: Are cars getting too big for the road?)
According to the EPA's 2023 automotive trends report, of the four largest vehicle types (sedan, pickup truck, SUV and minivan), ""all vehicle types are at record low CO2 emissions"". But the EPA notes that ""market shifts away from cars and towards SUVs and pickups have offset some of the fleetwide benefits"".
By 2035, the International Energy Agency (IEA) says there will need to be 790 million EVs on roads worldwide to hit the mid-century net zero target, up from less than 45 million in 2023.
""A shift to an electric vehicle is one of the single most impactful decisions that someone can make if they want to reduce their own emissions,"" says Jessika Trancik, professor of energy studies at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Boston. 
Trancik says electric pickup trucks produce emissions savings of between 30-60%, depending on the model and the location, compared with traditional pickups – a greater reduction than switching a smaller car to electric.
Trancik's team at MIT have created an online tool, called Carboncounter, which analyses the climate impact of about 1,000 different cars. According to Carboncounter, the F-150 Lightning produces 50% fewer greenhouse gas emissions per mile than the non-electric version.
""That includes the emissions that are incurred when you're producing the battery and building the vehicle,"" says Trancik.
However, electrification alone isn't a cure-all.
As electric cars get bigger and bulkier, their climate impact and environmental footprint also worsen, experts warn. Larger batteries are needed to power heavier electric pickup trucks, and manufacturing these is, currently, an energy-intensive process. Charging these big batteries also requires large amounts of electricity from the grid, the majority of which still comes from fossil fuels in the US.
Charging and manufacturing emissions aren't the only environmental concern with EVs. Lithium-ion batteries, which power EVs, are also difficult to recycle and extracting the lithium requires huge amounts of energy and water. 
Manufacturing an electric pickup emits more than producing a petrol or diesel pickup, Carboncounter's analysis shows. But when the driving is factored in, emissions are much lower across the entire lifecycle of the vehicle. 
""You're doing more extraction for the battery and less for the fuel in the electric vehicle… the comparison still comes out in favour of the electric vehicle,"" says Trancik.
A study by scientists at the University of Michigan found that electric sedans, SUVs and pickups powered by batteries have 64% lower greenhouse gas emissions over their lifetimes than internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles on average across the US.
Replacing an ICE pickup with a battery-electric one saves 74 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) over the lifetime of the vehicles, according to the study. This saving is equivalent to the emissions from driving 189,260 miles (304,580km) in an average ICE car.
The researchers also noted that battery-electric vehicles have larger greenhouse emissions during the manufacturing process, due to battery production, but that this is offset by savings in their operation.
As the US decarbonises its electricity grid and renewable electricity becomes more abundant, EV emissions will continue to fall, says David Reichmuth, an expert in new vehicle technologies at US non-profit the Union of Concerned Scientists. ""The net benefit of switching to an EV will increase over time,"" he says.
Reichmuth says it is important for consumers to choose the most efficient vehicle that meets their mobility needs. ""If people need a pickup truck for their livelihood, then we definitely see that switching from a gasoline to an electric version has huge climate benefits,"" says Reichmuth.
But if people are trading in their small petrol car for an electric pickup, ""you can still have a climate benefit, but you're going to have much less of a benefit than if you switch from a small gasoline car to a smaller electric car,"" he says.
Despite the clear environmental benefits of switching to electric models, the pickup's electrification still faces a few bumps in the road.
Ford recently postponed the launch of its next electric pickup truck, the successor to its F-150 Lightning. The Michigan carmaker had initially planned to start production of the electric truck next year in Tennessee, but the launch has now been pushed back to 2027.  
A number of factors have led to this delay, including the development of new battery technology and Ford's realisation that it needs to offer lower-cost pickup trucks. ""Taking the cost out of the product is certainly driving our evolving strategy,"" says Holycross. 
The high price of electric pickup trucks is a barrier preventing many consumers from upgrading to an EV, according to Trancik and Reichmuth.
There is a higher upfront cost when buying an electric pickup compared with a non-electric truck. The F-150 Lightning prices start at $62,995 (£47,680), compared with $38,610 (£29,221) for its non-electric pickup. Chevrolet's Silverado electric pickup starts at $96,495 (£73,032), compared with $38,795 (£29,366) for the non-electric version. 
According to MIT's Carboncounter, purchasing a F-150 Lightning pickup costs $390 (£296) per month compared to $312 (£236) for the non-electric version, but monthly maintenance and fuel costs are significantly lower for the electric car ($131/£99, compared with $259/£196). 
Car companies developing electric pickups are ""targeting the luxury pickup buyer"", says Reichmuth, adding that as demand and charging infrastructure increases companies are likely to offer more affordable models. Tesla took a similar approach, starting with the Tesla Model S, a luxury sedan, before moving into less expensive vehicles, he notes. 
Currently, electric pickup trucks remain out of reach for a lot of consumers, says Reichmuth. ""If you're a business that has a fleet of pickup trucks and you're looking to buy the cheapest option to meet your utility needs, that product is not available.""
Much of this cost challenge is down to the battery, which can account for half the total cost of the vehicle, says Trancik. ""You do need a lot of battery power because it's heavier,"" says Trancik. ""It's less efficient [than a smaller car] when it's operating because you have that higher drag and it's less streamlined.""
The upfront costs of buying an electric pickup are expected to decline as the price of lithium-ion batteries continues to fall, she adds. The cost of lithium-ion batteries has fallen by 97% since they were first commercially introduced in 1991, according to a 2021 study by Trancik. ""They improved in cost by about 10% per year"" between 1991 and 2021, says Trancik.
""Looking at it from a climate perspective, you really want those lower-cost models that are going to be more widely affordable if you want to bring overall emissions down,"" says Trancik. 
Holycross says that one of the new electric pickups that Ford is launching is a mid-sized truck that will be less expensive than the F-150 Lightning. ""That is coming in 2027 and is going to help with cost and also appeal to a wider range of truck buyers who maybe don't need the capability of a full-size truck,"" he says.
Electrifying the pickup truck, however, leaves one big flaw of these vehicles still unaddressed: the safety issues associated with size. Pedestrians hit by light trucks (SUVs and pickups) have been found to suffer higher rates of mortality and brain injury, a 2021 analysis found. ""There is a concern with the design of the current pickup truck – the height of the vehicle, the flat front and the limited visibility,"" says Reichmuth. ""Safety is not an issue with electric cars [specifically] but with the way pickup trucks are designed."" (Read more about the risks in our story here.)
This is just one issue that car companies will need to solve as they move towards electrification. ""It's called a transition for a reason – it's not happening overnight. It's quite a complicated problem to solve,"" says Trancik. ""But the situation is changing as you see more charging infrastructure become available and as people get more used to the changes that are associated with an electric vehicle.""

68,"article,news",,UK reveals father and son at heart of Evil Corp hackers,Technology,"The UK, US and Australia have announced sanctions against 16 people authorities accuse of being part of the most wanted cyber crime gang in the world.Russia-based Evil Corp is accused of stealing around $300m in nearly ten years of hacking.The UK’s National Crime Agency (NCA) says it can now reveal the gang’s notorious leader, Maksim Yakubets, has been supported by his father Viktor Yakubets - something he had denied when interviewed by the BBC in 2021.The information has been released as part of a large, multinational operation to disrupt Evil Corp and another notorious hacking group called LockBit.Known for their mafia-style of operation, Evil Corp has waged a campaign of destructive cyber-attacks worldwide for over a decade.In 2019, Maksim Yakubets was sanctioned and a $5m bounty was put up for his arrest, along with another man called Igor Turashev.Other Russian individuals, including Yakubets' brother Artem, were also named as part of the US sanctions and designations. In 2021 the BBC travelled to Russia to search for and interview members of the gang to get their side of the story.At a former home of Maksim Yakubets we found his father, who gave an impassioned defence of his son while claiming he was personally innocent.But now the NCA says that Yakubets senior was a major part of the cyber-crime group, accusing him of aiding the gang in laundering some of its stolen funds.
As well as the Yakubets family members, Maksim's father-in-law was also sanctioned for helping to protect and coordinate the group with his connections to the Russian security services.Western authorities have now officially linked Eduard Benderskiy, a former high-ranking FSB official, to Evil Corp.""Maksim Yakubets and his Evil Corp gang has for years lived the archetypal Russian hacker playboy lifestyle seemingly untouchable to law enforcement but today’s announcement shows that we are still watching, digging and determined to disrupt them and bring them to justice,"" said Will Lyne, Head of Cyber Intelligence at the NCA.
Another of those sanctioned is Aleksandr Ryzhenkov, described by the NCA as the younger Yakubets’ right-hand man, and an affiliate of the notorious ransomware gang LockBit.It's the first time that a member of Evil Corp has been linked to another major gang and indicates that hackers are working across groups to carry out attacks.As well as the sanctions, four arrests were made, including two in the UK. In August, the NCA executed a number of search warrants in the south of England and arrested a 46-year-old male who is suspected of being linked to a LockBit affiliate.  A 50-year-old female was also arrested on suspicion of money laundering offences. They too were interviewed and later released under investigation whilst the criminal investigation continues.Both individuals were identified through the analysis and enrichment of data acquired during the course of Operation Cronos - the international police operation that brought down LockBit's internal infrastructure. “The action announced today has taken place in conjunction with extensive and complex investigations by the NCA into two of the most harmful cybercrime groups of all time,"" said James Babbage, Director General for Threats at the NCA.The NCA said Evil Corp's  links to the Russian links to the Russian state had been exposed.""Today's sanctions send a clear message to the Kremlin that we will not tolerate Russian cyber-attacks - whether from the state itself or from its cyber-criminal ecosystem,"" said foreign secretary David Lammy.

69,"article,news",,Microsoft: 'ever present' AI assistants are coming,Technology,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) assistants with “really good long-term memory” are about a year away, according to Microsoft's head of AI, Mustafa Suleyman.Products which can recall conversations, projects and problems will encourage users to invest more time and share more of their personal history with them, he said in an exclusive interview with the BBC.“I think we’re moving to a fundamentally new age where there will be ever present, persistent, very capable co-pilot companions in your everyday life,” he added.Critics have voiced strong concerns around this level of integration, including data security, privacy, the possibility of AI tools giving bad advice or wrong information, or displaying inbuilt bias towards the person they are supposed to be helping.
But AI supporters argue that in order to be truly useful, these tools have to be deeply embedded into our lives: that they can only be really helpful if they know the history and context behind what they are being tasked to do.For example, an AI diary manager can only organise your diary if it can access that diary, edit it, and retain information about your activities.What is AI?Mr Suleyman argued that many people’s privacy expectations have changed over time.He said that devices such as TVs, laptops, phones, in-car cameras and earbuds are already “recording continuously everywhere” in ordinary environments, and gave a further example of an iPhone feature called Live View in which video and audio is recorded at the same time as a photo is taken.“Most people love that feature,” he said.“Some people turn it off but that’s a very distinct shift in the default expectation of what a photo is.”He added that the benefits of this kind of tech, whether people felt they could control their use of it, and whether they trusted the provider of it, were important factors in deciding whether to embrace it.
Microsoft has invested billions of dollars in OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, and has emerged as a market leader as the tech giants jostle in the race to develop and control the powerful and rapidly evolving technology.But some research suggests people are not consistently using it. A poll published by the Reuters Institute in August found that 29% of people in the UK that it spoke to had used ChatGPT, but only 2% used it every day.Mr Suleyman conceded that perhaps consumer AI tools would never be as globally popular as the smartphone.“Maybe this is different to the smartphone,” he said.“Nearly 90% of the planet has a smartphone. Maybe that will be different. Maybe 50% will reject [AI tools}.”But he added that so far, AI had been the fastest growing and adopted technology in history, despite its potential risks.He strongly rejected the idea, posed by many industry watchers including Jim Covello, head of stock research at Goldman Sachs, that AI might turn out to be a bubble, like some tech trends before it.He told me about a woman he met who said she had set up her business using guidance and motivation from a chatbot he developed called Pi.“We are clearly producing personalised, interactive knowledge at your fingertips at zero marginal cost,” he said.“The idea that this could be a bubble is utterly beyond me.”Microsoft has today unveiled a range of new additions to the tech giant’s AI assistant range CoPilot, including a voice function, a daily news digest and a slower chatbot for more difficult or in-depth questions called Think Deeper.It also includes CoPilot Vision, a tool which will sit within its Edge web browser and, when activated, observe web pages and “assist” with online activity.The firm says Vision will not record or store data, has to be switched-on manually and will close at the end of each browser session.Microsoft says it has chosen to limit which sites it will work with and there is as yet no release date for it.In the summer the tech giant paused the release of an AI tool called Recall, which takes screenshots every few seconds in order to help users find things they were looking at or working on previously, following a backlash from privacy campaigners and enquiries from the UK’s data watchdog about it.It will be re-launched in November with additional security measures.

70,"article,news",,Samsung accused of obstructing Fortnite downloads,Technology,"Epic Games has accused Samsung of making it too difficult to download its massively popular video game Fortnite on certain mobile devices.In a legal complaint it said it would file on Monday, it says people have to go through 21 steps before they can play the game on a new Samsung product, including viewing security warning screens and changing settings.Epic claims this means 50% of people who try to install the game on these devices give up before they complete the process.Samsung said it would ""vigorously contest"" the ""baseless claims"".According to Epic, the process takes 12 steps, rather than 21, for other Android phones and tablets.The firm has blamed a Samsung feature called Auto Blocker for the issue, which is turned on by default on the manufacturer's latest products.The tool is intended to block ""malicious activity"" and prevent app installations from unauthorised sources.Epic claims Auto Blocker is affecting Fortnite downloads, and says that goes against competition laws.Samsung has denied the allegations and says users can disable Auto Blocker if they choose.""Contrary to Epic Game's assertions, Samsung actively fosters market competition, enhances consumer choice, and conducts its operations fairly,"" it said.""The features integrated into our devices are designed in accordance with Samsung’s core principles of security, privacy, and user control, and we remain fully committed to safeguarding users' personal data.""Apps on Samsung or Google’s stores can be downloaded in just a couple of clicks, as the firms have already approved them.But Fortnite must be downloaded from Epic's own store – which triggers Samsung’s Auto Blocker feature to kick in with warnings about it.Epic claims both Google and Samsung know Fortnite is a legitimate app, and so there should not be any warnings flagged.That’s because it used to be available on Google Play – the official app store for Android-powered phones - and Samsung has even previously collaborated with it, running Fortnite competitions and creating digital skins for the game’s characters. “Epic’s latest lawsuit is a meritless and dangerous move,"" said Google engineering VP Dave Kleidermacher in a statement.He said Google did not ask Samsung to create their Auto Blocker feature, and Android device manufacturers could design their own additional safety tools.""While Android allows sideloading, Google and the security community have warned users for years about the real risks associated with downloading apps directly from the web,"" he said.He added that governments had also demanded additional safeguards for users, saying these and the ""real risks"" around downloading web apps were why Google offers safety tools that check for potentially harmful apps. ""To make this about access to a game is deliberately misleading; this is about user safety,"" he said.""And Epic's lawsuit puts their corporate interests above user protections.” 
Fortnite's developer has previously taken Google and Apple to court over disagreements about the way the tech firms operate their app stores.The game returned to EU-registered iPhones in August after Apple was ordered to open up its app marketplace, but it still can't be played on iOS in the UK.Epic boss Tim Sweeney said he was “very sad” to be initiating more legal action.""The fight against Samsung… is new, and it really sucks,"" he said. ""I did not think we would end up in this place.""He claimed Epic would have ""made a lot more money"" had it chosen not to pursue its previous legal action, but said he wanted to create a ""truly level playing field"" for developers.The game developer says it wants Samsung to introduce a process by which all legitimate third-party app developers can apply to be whitelisted from Auto Blocker but is has been unable to reach an agreement.Fortnite was removed from Apple and Google's app stores in 2020 after Epic introduced its own in-app payments system.And the developer won a lengthy court battle against Google over app store dominance in December 2023, with a jury deciding that Google had been operating a monopoly.

71,"article,features",,How tech creates hidden work for women,Future,"When it comes to using technology at home, women tend to do more of the day-to-day online work for the family, creating an extra digital burden.
My phone pings and it's the school chat group reminding us that it's a dress-up day. I scramble to fashion an outfit together for our children to wear. I do this without thinking about it, before my partner has a chance to help.
This is a common occurrence in many households, because despite men taking a more active role in parenting than in recent history, women still tend to be seen as the household organisers.
It's now been well established that in heterosexual relationships, women also do more of the hidden labour – the anticipating, planning and organising of the tasks that helps family life function. It creates a substantial mental workload at the intersection of cognitive and emotional labour. Less obvious is the fact that technology is exacerbating this, putting women at risk of digital overload and even burnout.
Clearly technology can help us be more productive in many areas of our lives. But at home, it is evident that technology is adding to women's already busy mental workloads. A recent cross-national study analysed data from the European Social Survey of more than 6,600 parents from 29 countries who had at least one child and one living parent. It found that the mental load on women, especially mothers, is exacerbated by technology. There appears to be a gender division of labour when it comes to digital communication regarding work and family life. 
The research team looked at technology use among the respondents. Men tended to use technology most at work but women used technology both at work and home. ""We find that women are more likely to be exposed to the double burden of digital communication in both work and family life,"" says lead author of the study Yang Hu from Lancaster University in the UK, who conducted the study alongside Yue Qian from the University of British Columbia in Canada. Women who worked from home also experienced more of this double burden.
It is an issue that has worsened as we conduct more of our lives online, and as working from home has become more common following the Covid-19 pandemic. Women are 1.6 times more likely than men to juggle dual-high digital communication both at work and at home, the researchers found.
Examples of what this means in practice aren't hard to find. My local mum's group is more active than the dad's group, and has many more participants (several hundred). This is where mums chat about events, rashes and parenting concerns. Even if a group is labelled as a parent's group, the most vocal participants, I find, are usually women.
One mum I know told me that she divides some of this digital communication with her partner, with her on the class chats and him on the emails – but unfortunately emails are a lot quieter than the instant chatter of texts. Household groceries, clothes and school supplies can all be bought digitally too, a digital extension of tasks women tend to do more of.
Many couples set out to be egalitarian but gendered patterns often creep in. That's why it's important to recognise the role technology plays when attempting to better share the load at home. We tend to use our digital devices for leisure as well as work, making it hard to delineate where personal use is recreational versus for the family, meaning it's an under-recognised form of labour. As the late feminist scholar Joan Acker highlighted, to challenge inequality we need to make the invisible visible. If you can't see it, we're not likely going to be aware of it. 
Another contributing factor that leads women to take on more digital work is linked to the fact that they tend to work more flexibly than men, taking on part-time roles for childcare needs. This exposes ""the flexibility paradox"", which is the idea that flexible working exploits women more than men, as it further emphasises their primary caregiver status. Working from home is often offered as a way for individuals, particularly women to juggle family and work responsibilities, says Hu, but that very flexibility can lead women to taking on more of the childcare organisation, which today is largely organised digitally.
The unfortunate consequence of this is that the more women take on at home, the less mental headspace they have for their professional lives, contributing to the gender pay gap, increased stress and higher relationship dissatisfaction. 
Heejung Chung a sociologist at King's College London in the UK who studies flexibility in the workplace, says flexible working exacerbates all aspects of housework and childcare. ""Women who work flexibly or from home tend to do more housework and childcare compared to women who do not, because they have the flexibility to squeeze in as many paid and unpaid hours into their day as possible.""
She found that women also feel pressure to do housework and childcare when working from home, whereas a father's boundary is much more respected, even if he's also at home. This is linked to the long history of the male breadwinner norm in heterosexual couples, where a man's work sphere has historically been more protected. It appears to still be the case even if the women are in high-earning managerial positions, says Chung – precisely because of the societal norm for women to be more involved in organising family life.
Despite the invisibility of this technology burden, there is some progress in the division of childcare, as men are taking on more of a share compared to 50 years ago, though still less than women.
There are some ways for couples to share the load more evenly too. If each in a couple completes a housework or childcare task end-to-end, rather than one organising and the other doing, that will also ensure the mental load is not only more shared but more visible. Many household tasks will have a digital element too, which means that aspect will also be shared.
Think of the scenario where one in a couple does the online grocery shopping and the other does the cooking, making this task feel shared. This means the shopper is the one who is most likely to consistently keep a mental tab of what groceries are needed. Cooking is only half the work. 
To fix the mental burden on women, sharing the visible aspects of care is not enough. Chung recommends dividing all aspects of digital communication for family life, whether it's taking on researching and booking extracurricular clubs or being active on community groups. She suggests having an open conversation about what each person does, including discussing all the planning and childcare worries.
One local mum I know says a shared calendar has helped her and her partner both be across their weekly schedule without each having to check in with the other. Another couple of two children organise the extracurricular schedules of one child each, which involves researching, booking and transporting them to it. For this type of organisation to work, they say regular communication is key.
The best advice Chung has is for fathers to take on more childcare on their own, supported by policies such as paid shared parental leave. The idea here being that the more active childcare will in time translate into digital organisation too. ""Then you get more of an equal playing field. It's essentially about who is responsible for the child and household in society.""
This shines a light on another great contradiction of modern society. We expect women to work and many families rely on dual incomes – but there is still a pervasive assumption that women are the primary carers of young children. As I wrote in my book The Motherhood Complex, women feel judged on how they parent more than fathers, making them feel as though they need to take on more of the organisation too. ""Those kinds of assumptions need to be broken for us to have any kind of meaningful discussion or change around these issues,"" Chung says. This is possible, take Sweden where paid parental leave has also translated into more equitable distribution of care work.
One way we can start to bring this hidden technical load to the forefront is to acknowledge this extra work and explicitly share it from the outset. Simple solutions could be to include the dads in local chat groups, to encourage them to organise more playdates – including all the communication involved – and to ensure we share the technological burden of the numerous school emails, homework tasks and club admin. The more we share in all aspects of the domestic sphere, the more this burden of the technical load will be shared too.

72,"article,news",,Worker shortage hampers datacentre boom,Technology,"If someone had asked Billy Keeper five years ago what a datacentre was, he admits: “I would not have had a clue.”The 24-year-old joined specialist electrical firm Datalec Precision Installations as a labourer straight from school.He’s now an electrical supervisor for the UK-based firm, and oversees teams up to 40-strong carrying out electrical and cabling installations at datacentres.This means, “managing the job, from a health and safety perspective, making sure everything goes smoothly, and dealing with the clients"".And those clients are central to today’s technology landscape. Datacentres are the massive warehouse-like buildings from which big tech firms like Amazon, Microsoft and Facebook deliver their cloud services.Other organisations, large and small, run their own dedicated facilities, or rely on “co-location” datacentres to host their computer equipment.
Demand for datacentre space has been turbocharged in recent years by the rise of artificial intelligence, which demands ever more high-end computers, and ever more electricity to power them.Total datacentre floorspace across Europe was just over six million sq ft (575,418 sq m) in 2015, according to real estate firm Savills, but will hit more than 10 million sq ft this year. In London alone, datacentre “take up” in 2025 will be almost triple that of 2019, predicts real estate services firm CBRE.But while demand is surging, says Dame Dawn Childs, chief executive of UK-based operator, Pure Data Centres Group, “delivering and satisfying that demand is challenging.”Just finding enough land or power for new datacentres is a problem. Labour’s election manifesto promised to overhaul planning to encourage the building of infrastructure, including datacentres and the power networks they rely on.
But the industry is also struggling to find the people to build them.“There's just not enough skilled construction workers to go around,” says Dame Dawn.For companies like Datalec, it’s not just a case of recruiting staff from more traditional construction sectors.Datacentre operators – whether co-location specialists or the big tech firms – have very specific needs. “It is very, very fast. It's very, very highly engineered,” says Datalec’s operations director (UK & Ireland), Matt Perrier-Flint.“I've done commercial premises, I've worked in universities,” he explains. But the datacentre market is particularly regimented, he says, with everything carried out “in a calculated and structured way.”
Commissioning a single piece of equipment, such as one of the chiller units that keep temperatures stable within a datacentre, will involve multiple tests and “witnessing”, Mr Perrier-Flint explains, before a final full building test, with failover scenarios.Operators will have strict timeframes to complete a datacentre build or upgrade. At the same time, they won’t want to disrupt key business periods – ecommerce operators will typically put a freeze on any work in the runup to Christmas for example.This can mean long days for Datalec’s teams, or even running shifts overnight.If the demands are high, the rewards are significant too. Experienced electrical installers can make six figure salaries.Nevertheless, companies like Datalec face a constant battle to ensure they have enough suitably qualified staff on hand.
The Construction Industry Training Board predicts the UK needs to recruit 50,300 extra workers annually for the next five years. Many are concerned that the construction workforce is greying.Dame Dawn says, “I think, along with all of the other technical industries, we're having difficulty feeding the pipe.”One reason for the shortfall is a focus on university education at the expense of traditional technical or apprenticeship routes in recent decades.Mr Perrier-Flint says that when he was younger, the consensus was “you can never go wrong with a trade, you can never go wrong with construction"".But there are more choices to tempt young people now, he suggests, including software development or other technology careers. Or indeed being an influencer on the very platforms run out of the datacentres.Mark Yeeles, vice president, Secure Power Division, UK and Ireland, at power and automation firm Schneider Electric, began as an apprentice in the 1990s.Given that the industry is often looking for people with 15 years’ experience, he says, “The time to start investing in apprentices was 10 years ago.”However, Schneider Electric is changing its ratio of graduates to apprentices. “We’ve doubled our intake of apprentices,” says Mr Yeeles.
The entire industry must rethink how it recruits younger people, he adds. “My team needs to reflect the communities we’re working in,” he says, including in terms of gender, background, and experience.And it needs to consider the career pathways it offers and recognise young people’s need for a “mission” or “purpose”. Schneider Electric, for example, has launched a sustainability apprenticeship program.Dame Dawn agrees about the need to increase diversity and recognise recruits’ need for a mission.“In terms of a purpose, we're serving the whole population,” she says. “And if we could be part of the solution for net zero, then it's serving a significant purpose, because it's enabling humanity to drive forward.”But perhaps the first challenge is simply explaining to potential recruits why datacentres and the cloud are central to so many facets of modern life.As Billy Keeper says, “You try and explain to someone what the cloud is and what we offer. And they look up at the sky.”

73,"article,features",,The UK coal plant that became a giant battery,Future,"With the closure of the last coal-fired power station in the UK, it raises questions about how old fossil fuel infrastructure can be repurposed. One option is to use them to store energy from renewables.
It's an unassuming place for a major era of British history to come to an end. Surrounded by farmland drenched by recent rains and trees with leaves starting to turn ahead of the autumn – all within earshot of the thundering traffic from the M1 motorway – the UK's last coal-fired power station is shutting down for good. As of 30 September 2024 the turbines at the Ratcliffe-on-Soar power plant in Nottinghamshire will fall silent while smoke and steam will cease to belch from the chimney and cooling towers that dominate this part of the landscape.
The power station, which has been operating since 1967, is to undergo a two-year decommissioning and demolition process.
It's a symbolic moment, a marker along the UK's journey to decarbonisation and net-zero. For centuries, coal was the main source of energy in the UK. It was the life-blood of the industrial revolution – providing the fuel for steam engines and then generating much of the country's electricity. By the 1960s, nearly 90% of the UK's electricity relied upon coal.
Now, for the first time, the UK will not use any coal to generate electricity.
It's not clear what the Ratcliffe-on-Soar site will become. There have been suggestions it could house a prototype fusion reactor or some other green industry. Regardless, as fossil fuel power plants are shuttered in many parts of the world, the question of what to do with them will keep coming up.
One promising option is to turn old fossil power plants into battery storage sites.
Renewable energy sources like wind and solar are the mainstay of the net-zero transition. They don't emit greenhouse gases, so the more they replace fossil fuels like coal and gas the closer we come to net-zero emissions.
The share of energy coming from renewables is rising steadily. According to a report by the International Energy Agency published in January 2024, renewables will generate 33.5% of global electricity this year and could account for 41.6% by 2028.
However, using renewables comes with challenges for power grids. Coal and gas plants can be turned on and off at will, so they can supply more energy when it is needed: they are ""dispatchable"", in the jargon of the field. By contrast, renewable sources are intermittent and less controllable: the Sun doesn't shine at night and the wind doesn't always blow (and sometimes can blow too much).
""With renewables, we have less dispatchable power,"" says Grazia Todeschini, an electrical engineer at King's College London in the UK.
To some extent, the intermittency problem can be managed by having a diverse selection of renewable sources: that way, if one doesn't generate enough, another can pick up the slack. Nuclear power, which is zero-carbon, also offers a steady supply.
Alongside this, though, countries are investing heavily in energy storage. When lots of electricity is generated but isn't needed, it can be stored – then when there is a shortage it can be released. ""The main point is to be able to match generation and demand,"" says Todeschini.
For many decades, the most important form of energy storage was pumped hydropower. Excess electricity was used to pump water uphill, so that it could be released to drive turbines and generate electricity when needed. However, this won't be enough for the renewable era, and hydropower has its own emission problems too. ""That capacity pretty much is saturated everywhere, in Europe at least,"" says Todeschini. ""There is no space to build any more.""
That's why many countries are turning instead to battery energy storage systems (BESS). A BESS site is simply an array of batteries: big ones, about the size of shipping containers. Excess electricity from renewable sources can be dumped into the batteries, ready to be discharged when demand is high.
""In the last 20 years, this technology has improved a lot,"" says Todeschini. ""The control is more precise, and also the cost has decreased.""
All of which explains why one of the UK's defunct coal plants is being turned into a BESS site.
Near Ferrybridge in West Yorkshire sit the remains of a trio of coal-fired power plants. Between them they operated for almost a century, the first one turning on in 1927 and the last being decommissioned in 2016. The third station, Ferrybridge C, passed into the ownership of energy company SSE in 2004, which ran it until the site's closure and demolition.
Now SSE is building a BESS on the site of Ferrybridge C. It will have a capacity of 150 megawatts, which SSE estimates will be enough to power 250,000 homes. Construction began in August 2023, and in June 2024 the first batteries arrived. The following month, the last of the 136 battery units were installed.
""We're now at the point all the kit's on site,"" says Heather Donald of SSE Renewables, where she is director of onshore wind, solar and battery for Great Britain and Ireland. ""We're just about to go into the commissioning phase and we're hoping to switch on early next year.""
Building an array of batteries on the site of an old coal-fired power station has multiple advantages, says Donald. ""First and foremost, there's a grid connection there,"" she says. That means linking the BESS to the grid is as straightforward as it can be. ""Access to grid connections and grid capacity's at such a premium now.""
The site also proved to have a lot of useful materials and infrastructure. ""We've been able to use some of the existing concrete foundations, we've been able to repurpose some of the concrete on site,"" says Donald. This meant the company did not need to import many materials, apart from the batteries themselves.
""It's a great reuse of a site like this,"" says Donald.
If the UK is to achieve its decarbonisation targets, it will need a lot more BESS projects like Ferrybridge.
Some indication of quite how many more can be gleaned from the latest Future Energy Scenarios report, released in July 2024 by National Grid. The report finds the UK had 4.7 gigawatts (GWs) of battery storage in 2023. That's a lot, but the UK government has set a legally binding target of net-zero emissions by 2050. Depending on quite how this is achieved, the country will need storage of between 29 gigawatts and 36 gigawatts by 2050. Even the lower figure is only possible if the UK stores a lot of its energy in the form of hydrogen. Currently, most hydrogen comes from fossil fuel sources, so a switch to greener alternatives is needed. If green hydrogen does not take off, the country will need more BESS to compensate.
In short, the UK's BESS capacity needs to increase by a factor of at least six, and possibly closer to eight, in the next quarter-century.
Many more BESS sites are in the pipeline for the UK. In June 2024, plans were approved for a BESS facility in a field near the hamlet of Wineham in West Sussex. Another near Sunderland was recommended by city planners in August. Weeks later, a similar facility was approved for agricultural land in Cumbria.
Given the massive increase in battery capacity needed, disused power stations like Ferrybridge C are a tempting option. ""To be able to use former energy sites for new carbon-free energy is definitely something we're looking to do more of,"" says Donald.
Indeed, SSE is already building a second BESS on another coal-fired power station site. Fiddler's Ferry in Warrington, Cheshire, was shut down in 2020, and in December 2023 the company announced it would turn it into a 150-megawatt BESS. Construction began in the spring of 2024.
""I agree it makes sense to use a site where there is already some of this infrastructure,"" says Todeschini.
That said, not all ex-fossil-fuel power stations will be suitable for BESS. ""It really depends a lot on the location,"" says Todeschini. For instance, a site that's a long way from residential neighbourhoods might not be suitable. Instead, such sites could be repurposed as wind farms or other forms of generation. Todeschini also suggests charging sites for fleets of electric vehicles.
""I'm an advocate for this kind of mixed approach, in general, for the energy transition,"" says Todeschini. ""My approach is to really consider all options.""
Nevertheless, many former fossil fuel power plants around the world are being repurposed for batteries.

In the Lusatia region of Germany, there is an intricate system of coal mines and thermal power plants operated by the energy company LEAG. In 2023, the company – which specialises in the dirtiest form of coal, lignite – announced a plan to transform the entire complex into a ""green energy hub"". This will include wind and solar, hydrogen and batteries, and is intended to be completed by 2040. An early step will be to convert the Boxberg coal plant into a BESS facility, to be operational by 2027. In June 2024, LEAG secured €58 million of European Union funding to support the project.
On the other side of the world, the former Liddell Power Station in New South Wales, Australia, is becoming the Liddell Battery. The site's owner AGL Energy announced the project in December 2023 and construction began in June 2024. The 500-megawatt batteries should come online in December 2025.
Finally, Nevada is home to a project that is already storing and supplying electricity. The coal-fired Reid Gardner Power Station, 50 miles (80km) north-east of Las Vegas, was demolished in 2020. A company called Energy Vault has since replaced it with the Reid Gardner Battery Energy Storage System, which has a capacity of 220 megawatts. The site came online in late April 2024.
The more projects like these come online, the better they will become, argues Donald. ""It's obviously an emerging technology,"" she says. Donald expects BESS to become more efficient and to be able to discharge electricity for longer periods – helping ensure a secure electricity supply after all the fossil fuel plants have been turned off for good.

74,"article,news",,Uber terms mean couple can't sue after 'life-changing' crash,Technology,"A couple who were left with life-changing injuries after their Uber crashed have been told they cannot sue the company because of the terms they accepted when using the app.Georgia and John McGinty, from New Jersey, in the US, are bound by a clause saying they could not take the case to a jury in a court of law.State judges ruled they had clicked a ""confirm"" button on the app on more than one occasion when asked if they agreed with Uber's terms of use.The McGintys argue they had not understood they were forfeiting their right to sue the company.They told the BBC the most recent time the terms were agreed to was when their daughter, then 12, had accepted them prior to ordering a pizza on Uber Eats.""How would I ever remotely think that my ability to protect my constitutional rights to a trial would be waived by me ordering food?"" said Mrs McGinty.Uber told BBC News: ""Our Terms of Use are clear that these types of claims should be resolved in arbitration. It’s important to highlight that the court concluded the plaintiff herself, not her daughter, agreed to Uber's Terms of Use on multiple occasions.""
Arbitration means the dispute is settled through a third party rather than in court - in this case a lawyer appointed by Uber.Legal experts say it tends to result in smaller financial settlements.The case has parallels with Disney's attempt to avoid being sued over a death at Disney World - in its case over the terms of a Disney+ membership - before the company changed its mind.
In March 2022, Georgia and John McGinty were riding in an Uber in New Jersey when it crashed, and they suffered extensive injuries.Mrs McGinty's injuries included spine fractures and traumatic injuries to her abdominal wall.""I was in the critical care unit for a week,"" she told the BBC.""I had a horrible post-operative infection and almost died during this time, I wasn't able to care for my child who was suffering from unrelated injury,"" she said.John fractured his sternum and sustained injuries to his hand.""I shattered my wrist, broke my hand, and I have a steel rod with about nine pins in it. I don't have full function of my left hand,"" he said. ""I am in pain every day.""He added that they ""accumulated a tremendous amount of medical debt"" and still need further medical treatment in the future, including a possible third operation for Georgia.
The couple attempted to sue Uber over the crash, citing the seventh amendment of the US Constitution, which grants people the right to a trial by jury. But the tech firm argued that the couple could not take the case in front of a jury because of a clause in Uber's US Terms of Use.The Superior Court of New Jersey, Appellate Division agreed.""We hold that the arbitration provision contained in the agreement under review, which Georgia or her minor daughter, while using her cell phone agreed to, is valid and enforceable,"" its judgement says.The judgment found the child had clicked the button to say she was 18 despite not being.Referring to her daughter's use of Uber Eats, Mrs McGinty says she does not know how it can be right that she is considered to have ""authorised my child to waive our rights to go to a trial if we're injured in a car accident."" ""I don't know how anybody makes that leap,"" she said.
Arbitration clauses are ""very common,"" especially when dealing with large corporations, said Ted Spaulding, a personal injury lawyer based in the state of Georgia.An arbitrator is ""most often a lawyer who does this for a living,"" he said, who can ""act like a judge and a jury"".They decide on an outcome after weighing up arguments from both sides, and their fee is often split between both parties. In the US, the enforceability of arbitration clauses differs state by state.In its case, Disney used the arbitration clause in their terms to argue that a man whose wife died at Disney World could not sue them in a court of law. Jeffrey Piccolo filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Disney after his wife, Dr Kanokporn Tangsuan, died following an allergic reaction at a restaurant, run by a third party, at Disney World Florida in 2023.Disney said Mr Piccolo had waived his right to a jury trial when he signed up to a free trial of Disney+ in 2019.Disney later withdrew its claim to arbitration and opted to proceed with a jury trial after media coverage of the lawsuit.""We believe this situation warrants a sensitive approach to expedite a resolution for the family who have experienced such a painful loss,"" Disney executive Josh D'Amaro told the BBC in a statement in August.Mr Spaulding says: ""The law understandably says, 'Look, you have the duty to know what you're signing',"" referring to the terms and conditions people often accept when using a product or a service. However, he says ""the scope should be within the transaction that you're agreeing to"".
Georgia and John McGinty say the Uber case has been ""absolutely devastating"" to their family. Georgia says their daughter, now 14, ""suffered a lot of trauma as a result"".She had a separate physical health issue which she was going through at the time, which her parents found difficult to help with while going through their own injuries. ""Years of her life with her parents... were taken away,"" she says.""Luckily, she's a fighter, like her parents are,"" says John. ""We are inadvertently teaching her adversity and strength and family and prayer and resilience.""
Uber told BBC News: ""The court concluded that on multiple occasions the plaintiff herself agreed to Uber's Terms of Use, including the arbitration agreement.""The company added: ""We are dedicated to road safety.""

75,"article,news",,'Everybody wants to be in': How songs are chosen for EA FC,Technology,"“Most musicians, one of our dreams, one our goals – it’s not the Grammys, it’s not the Oscars – it’s to get a song on Fifa, man.”That's Femi Koleoso, from Ezra Collective, on why getting on Fifa - now known as EA FC - is such a big deal.Each year, around a hundred songs get selected for the soundtrack of the world's favourite football video game.But how do they get chosen from the countless acts desperate to make their name on it?""It's a brutal question to answer,"" EA's president of music, Steve Schnur, told me, as he gave the BBC a rare peek behind the curtain of how the game studio makes its decisions.""We go through thousands and thousands of songs,"" he says""At the very beginning, I was flying around like a madman, looking everywhere for the next great thing. ""Now, humbly speaking, everybody wants to be in EA FC, so people come to us.""
But of course, the process is not really about the acts - but the gamer.""I can't always base it on who we like or who we have history with,"" Mr Schnur said. ""Ultimately, my boss is the player, the person that bought the copy of the game, sometimes with their parents' money."" He told me the tune has to ""fit a tone"", though there is no specific genre.""Even if a song doesn't end up in the game, there's many songs that you probably hear on Radio 1 where you go, that's an EA FC band, or that's an EA FC song,"" he told me.""They can be popular - it can be Skepta, it can be Dua Lipa - but we also want to make sure it's that band from York that you haven't heard of yet.""
But, if you're that unheard of band, how does EA even find out that you exist?Simply put, a lot of digging.""There's a band from Yorkshire, they're 15 and 16 years old, that I came across online recently, and I reached out to them and said I'm Steve Schnur from EA Sports FC,"" he said.""They sent me these Instagram messages back immediately, saying, 'is this a joke?'""Exciting for the band - which Mr Schnur would not name - but he says it's a thrill for him too.""Nothing's better than reaching out to that band and literally saying, out of the blue, 'hey, I want to put you in the game this year',"" he said.For the bands, it can be transformative - for acts including Kasabian and Catfish and the Bottlemen, getting exposure on Fifa helped them go on to become household names.
One of the tracks on this year's game is from British act, Good Neighbours, comprised of Oli Fox and Scott Verill.They may be a long way from a Kasabian-style stadium tour - but they've got a song in EA FC 25.""It's unreal,"" Scott told me.""I've played the game since I was a kid, and I've always discovered bands through playing it.""The connection with the game extends to their fans too.""Ever since we've started posting music online, all our fans have always been like: 'get this on EA FC',"" he said.Where bands once might have hoped someone from a record label would unexpectedly turn up, now there is hype around the possible appearance of a gaming industry representative.""Someone teased us with a rumour - someone from EA is going to be at your gig tonight - it was crazy... and then we just had a sick gig, I guess,"" Scott said.
But that's not the only link between Good Neighbours, football and EA FC.Morgan Fox, Oli's brother, plays professional football for QPR - and has featured in Fifa since his debut for Charlton in 2013.""He's been on it for some time, and it's been a real frustration of mine,"" he joked.""Literally since we were kids we've played it together in a horrible rivalry growing up, and then only the penny dropped maybe about 10 years ago that we could possibly exist on the same game.""Our parents would finally be proud of us, and all those evenings wasted in our childhood playing FIFA, and when we finally ticked it off, we got a nice message from mum and dad saying that they're very proud.""Who needs a Grammy?

76,"article,news",,Microsoft re-launches ‘privacy nightmare’ AI screenshot tool,Technology,"Microsoft says it has “listened to feedback” following a privacy row over a new tool which takes regular screenshots of users’ activity.It was labelled a potential “privacy nightmare” by critics when it was unveiled in May 2024 - prompting the tech giant to postpone its release.It now plans to relaunch the artificial intelligence (AI) powered tool in November on its new CoPilot+ computers.Some of its more controversial features have been stripped out - for example, it will be opt-in whereas the original version was turned on by default.The controversy over Recall had led the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), the UK’s data watchdog, to “make enquiries” with the tech giant about the tool. It said it had now been informed that a ""series of changes"" had been made to the product.""We will be continuing to assess Recall as Microsoft moves toward launch"", it said in a statement.
When it initially announced the tool at its developer conference in May, Microsoft said it used AI ""to make it possible to access virtually anything you have ever seen on your PC"", and likened it to having photographic memory.It said Recall could search through a users' past activity, including their files, photos, emails and browsing history.It was designed to help people find things they had looked at or worked on previously by searching through desktop screenshots taken every few seconds.But critics quickly raised concerns, given the quantity of sensitive data the system would harvest, with one expert labelling it a potential “privacy nightmare.""Recall was never made publicly available.A version of the tool was set to be rolled out with CoPilot+ computers - which Microsoft billed as the fastest, most intelligent Windows PCs ever built - when they launched in June, after Microsoft told users it had made changes to make it more secure.But its launch was delayed further and has now been pushed back to the autumn. The company has also announced extra security measures for it.“Recall is an opt-in experience. Snapshots and any associated information are always encrypted,"" said Pavan Davuluri, Microsoft's corporate vice president of Windows and devices.He added that ""Windows offers tools to help you control your privacy and customise what gets saved for you to find later"". However a technical blog about it states that “diagnostic data” from the tool may be shared with the firm depending on individual privacy settings.The firm added that screenshots can only be accessed with a biometric login, and sensitive information such as credit card details will not be snapped by default.Recall is only available on the CoPilot+ range of bespoke laptops featuring powerful inbuilt AI chips.Professor Alan Woodward, a cybersecurity expert at Surrey University, said the new measures were a significant improvement.“Before any functionality like Recall is deployed the security and privacy aspects will need to be comprehensively tested,” he said.However he added he would not be rushing to use it.“Personally I would not opt-in until this has been tested in the wild for some time.”

77,"article,news",,MoD steps in to buy chip-making plant for £20m,Technology,"More than 100 jobs have been saved at a semiconductor factory after the government stepped in to buy the closure-threatened plant.The Ministry of Defence (MoD) has paid £20m for the former Coherent chip-making facility at Newton Aycliffe, County Durham.Coherent, which also makes chips used by the military, had considered closing the site after losing a big contract with iPhone maker Apple.Defence Secretary John Healey said: ""We simply can’t afford as a country to let this company get into the wrong hands or to go under.""
During a visit of the site on Friday, he said the plant did something ""no-one else in the UK does"".Mr Healey defended the move to bail out the factory, which will be renamed Octric Semiconductors UK, even though the former owner could be seen as failing.
""This is exactly what an active government should do,"" he said.""It safeguards national security, it boosts British jobs, and I want to make sure that we grow the company and not just save it.""The purchase by the MoD is the latest chapter in a chequered history for the giant manufacturing facility.It was opened by the Japanese company Fujitsu in 1991, creating 600 jobs and promising many hundreds more.However, the plant was closed in 1998 with the loss of the entire workforce. The company had struggled to keep up with advances in chip technology.Since then it has been through multiple ownerships.

79,"article,news",,How pen and paper comes to the rescue in an IT crisis,,"When the CrowdStrike software bug bricked 8.5 million computers around the world on 19 July, some of the first people to notice the effects were air travellers.Anthony Bosman, an academic at Andrews University in Michigan was trying to board his flight from Michigan to Florida when he realised he couldn’t download a mobile boarding pass to his smartphone.So he went to check in at the airport, in person, and watched in amazement as an airline employee looked up his name on a paper list and then wrote out his boarding pass  – by hand.“It felt like a blast from the past,” he recalls. “The ticket agent, I remember how she commented that her hand was tired from having to write so many of them.” His flight took off as planned.Multiple other passengers, including many in India, reported having the same experience that day.The CrowdStrike bug also hit banks, telecoms firms, health services and online retailers.This week a senior executive at the firm appeared before a US congressional committee and said he was ""deeply sorry"" for the chaos caused.For a brief moment in July, some organisations had to forget about their computer-based processes and do things the old-fashioned way.
If you look through articles about past cyber-attacks and IT failures on the BBC News website, you’ll find countless examples of organisations that have had to “go back to pen and paper” in the face of disruption.British GPs, staff at foreign exchange firm Travelex, medics at Rouen hospital in France and employees of Lincolnshire County Council have all experienced this.It sounds an almost pitiful predicament. And yet, while it certainly isn’t desirable, some cyber-experts are now advising companies to plan for switching to paper-based processes in the event of IT failure. Rather than an ad hoc workaround, pen and paper systems could be something staff practise using from time to time so that they can switch away from their computers seamlessly if required.
One company that knows the value of paper is Norsk Hydro, a Norwegian aluminium and renewable energy firm.In 2019, hackers targeted Hydro with ransomware that locked staff out of more than 20,000 computers. Bosses at Hydro decided they would not pay a ransom fee to restore access, meaning that 35,000 staff working across 40 countries had to find other ways of doing their jobs, temporarily.They dug old binders out of basements with instructions on how to produce particular aluminium products, for instance, recalls Halvor Molland, a spokesman for Hydro. At some locations, by sheer chance, staff had printed out order requests just before the cyber-attack hit.“Their creativity… was tremendous,” says Mr Molland. While computers with customer information and company data were locked out, factory equipment was mercifully unaffected by the ransomware. At some facilities, staff bought computers and printers from local retailers so they could print off information for factory workers. And vintage office kit came in handy. “We actually had to dust off some old telefaxes,” remembers Mr Molland.Although production fell by up to 50% at certain plants, these workarounds kept the business going. “You need to do what you need to do,” as Mr Molland puts it. Reflecting, he suggests that companies might want to keep printed copies of key information such as internal telephone numbers or checklists so that some work can continue even in the event of a massive cyber-attack.
“People have realised the importance of having these manual methods because of the severity of some of the recent cyber-attacks and IT outages,” says Chris Butler, resilience director at disaster recovery and business continuity firm Databarracks.He mentions one customer his company works with – an industrial distribution firm – that has put together ""disaster recovery packs” and sent them to all of its branches. The packs include paper forms and a fax machine – a contingency in case their digital ordering system becomes unavailable. “If that goes down, their only alternative, they realised, was to have these forms.”Mr Butler suggests that companies have a training day where employees practise using flipcharts and whiteboards instead of computers, to see if they can still do their jobs effectively that way.Some organisations recommend using paper for security reasons. Parts of the US court system require certain documents to be filed on either paper, for example, or a secure device such as an encrypted USB drive.Obviously there are limits to paper-based processes. Mr Butler notes that if bankers, for example, lose access to their trading terminals during an IT incident, they can’t easily switch to paper-based alternatives.
The biggest problem with pen and paper systems is that they don’t scale well, says Gareth Mott, from the Royal United Services Institute. It’s slower than using a computer for many tasks ,and it’s hard or perhaps impossible to coordinate thousands of employees using such methods across multiple office locations.But practising workarounds really can help, adds Dr Mott. He and colleagues have researched how “war-gaming” and IT failure roleplay exercises can impact employees’ responses to real-life cyber-attacks. “We found that the companies that had done that, sometimes a few weeks before they had a live incident, really benefitted,” he says.It’s not just pen and paper that could come in handy. Dr Mott is aware of one firm that bought “crates worth of Chromebooks” for staff in the wake of a cyber-incident, so that they could work without needing access to the company network. Some companies might have dormant WhatsApp or Signal messaging groups that they can ask employees to use for internal communications, if access to the company email servers goes down, for instance.Both Dr Mott and Mr Butler stress the importance of off-site or otherwise segregated data backups so that, in the event of a ransomware attack, all that vital information is not necessarily lost.
Cathy Miron is chief executive of eSilo, a data backup firm based in Florida. There are hundreds of such companies around the world, including Databarracks, that provide secure data backup services.Ms Miron’s company offers off-site, cloud-based data storage on a separate network to that of their customers; and on-site, custom-built servers as well. “We have had a 100% ransomware recovery rate thus far,” she says.For all the sophistication of contemporary computer systems, it’s the simple, improvised workarounds that can save companies when a crisis hits. Mrs Miron mentions one customer who, at the time of writing, was using a Verizon mi-fi, or mobile broadband wireless router, system to access backup data because their main computer network had been completely shut down following a cyber-incident.“You should expect it, at some point in time, to be a victim of a cyber-attack,” emphasises Mr Molland. “What do you do in the meantime? How do you keep the wheels turning?”

80,"article,news",,Assassin's Creed Shadows release date delayed to 2025,Technology,"Ubisoft has announced its highly-anticipated upcoming game Assassin's Creed Shadows has been delayed until next year.Instead of releasing it on 12 November as previously planned, it has been pushed back to 14 February 2025.It follows the disappointing performance of another of the firm's major titles, Star Wars Outlaws, and concerns from some about how Ubisoft is being run. The game's executive producer Marc-Alexis Cote said the developers ""need more time to polish and refine the experience"".""We understand this decision will come as disappointing news,"" he said.""But we sincerely believe this is in the best interest of the game.""In a trading update sent to Ubisoft's investors, seen by the BBC, the firm - which is headquartered in France - said despite the game being ""feature complete"" it needed more time.""The learnings from the Star Wars Outlaws release led us to provide additional time to further polish the title,"" it reads.Star Wars Outlaws was released in August to strong reviews, but early players complained of bugs and glitches.In its trading update, Ubisoft notes sales of the game were ""softer than expected"", which it seemed to be putting down to a lack of polish.Mr Cote said the firm would refund fans who had pre-ordered the game, and promised a free expansion to anyone who placed a new pre-order for the revised launch.
When it finally arrives, Assassin's Creed Shadows will be the first game in the series to be set in Japan - a setting fans have been clamouring for since the series began in 2007.The decision to push the game back beyond Christmas - usually a lucrative time for game sales - will not have been made lightly.But the sales performance of Star Wars Outlaws caused Ubisoft's shares to take a serious hit, when the firm would have been hoping the game would set it back on course.They have fallen to a price of 11.32 euros a share at the time of writing - the lowest in a decade.A minority investor wrote a letter to the board earlier this month calling for the company to either be taken private or sold to an investor.Ubisoft co-founder and boss Yves Guillemot said the move to push back Assassin's Creed Shadows' launch was a result of the firm's second quarter performance - which ""fell sort of our expectations"".""We remain committed to creating games for fans and players that everyone can enjoy,"" he said.

81,"article,news",,James McAvoy and Tom Brady fall for 'Goodbye Meta AI' hoax,Technology,"More than 600,000 people, including many celebrities, have fallen for a hoax claiming to deny Facebook and Instagram owner Meta the right to use their images for training artificial intelligence (AI).Film stars James McAvoy and Ashley Tisdale, as well as former NFL player Tom Brady, are among those who re-shared the fake ""Goodbye Meta AI"" message on Instagram stories.The hoax claims that by sharing the message, Meta would no longer be able to use their information.In reality, Facebook and Instagram users who want to opt out of AI training can do so in their account settings - and posting about it does nothing.Many of these messages have now been labelled ""false information"" by Lead Stories, one of Meta's third-party fact-checking sites.The post appears to have been created in opposition to Meta's announcement in June that it will use public posts to train its AI model - but the company has confirmed to the BBC that posting the message has no impact on any user’s privacy settings.“Sharing this story does not count as a valid form of objection,” a Meta spokesperson said.
Lead Stories pinpointed the origin of the trend to a post on Facebook on 1 September, which used slightly different wording to the version that eventually went viral.But it was not until this week - when large celebrity accounts began to share the post - that the craze took hold, with Google Trends displaying a steep spike in searches for the phrase ""Goodbye Meta AI"" after 24 September.It is far from the first time that social media has been dominated by such ""copypasta"" - a term meaning a block of text that is ""copied and pasted"" frequently online.The fact-checking website Snopes has covered several instances from the past decade of users declaring their privacy rights in public messages to no avail.But it is rare to see quite so many high-profile accounts fall for the hoax.Plans for other social media companies to train AI models on public posts have also been met with criticism, with LinkedIn this week reversing its decision to do so in the UK.

""I was at the forefront of CGI over three decades ago, and I’ve stayed on the cutting edge since. ""Now, the intersection of generative AI and CGI image creation is the next wave.""Amongst his long list of hit movies, Cameron is known for creating special effects-heavy Avatar, the highest-grossing film of all time.His new place of work, StabilityAI, is best known for making Stable Diffusion - which can generate images based on a user's text prompt.It is also branching out into video, with Stable Video Diffusion, which works in the same way.It is this tech that Cameron seems to have been brought on to help develop.Proponents of AI video generation say it will enable artists to quickly create complicated digital effects.But for many creatives - and Cameron's contemporaries - this use of the technology is considered controversial at best.Last week, Pan's Labyrinth director Guillermo del Toro criticised AI-generated video during a talk at the British Film Institute in London, saying it could not generate much beyond ""semi-compelling screensavers"".Michael Bay said last year the tech ""will create a whole bunch of lazy people"" because ""it doesn't create, it just imitates"".And Hiyao Miyazaki, who wrote and directed animated classic Spirited Away, previously said he was ""disgusted"" by an AI-generated video and called it ""an insult to life itself"".
Rashik Parmar, head of BCS, The Chartered Institute for IT, told the BBC the filmmaker's appointment comes at a time when ""many of society’s fears about AI"" come from movies.""We watch Terminator and we form the idea that AI has malicious intentions towards humanity and that it will destroy us in the near future,"" he said.""Cameron has a real opportunity to change the narrative and build a positive view of AI, we’re very happy to work with him on that.""One of Cameron's first challenges in his new role will be to shore up StabilityAI's position in the wider generativeAI landscape, where it faces stiff competition.OpenAI's rival video generation tool Sora is the most high-profile name in the space, with Reuters reporting Hollywood executives have discussed with the firm how the film industry could use its tech.Meanwhile, Hunger Games and John Wick studio Lionsgate made a deal last week with AI firm Runway to create tools based on its massive archive of film and TV.And in recent weeks the video generation landscape has been shaken by the sudden emergence of MiniMax, created by China-based HailuoAI. The tool became popular on social media this month thanks to its ability to quickly create high-quality video from just a few lines of text.In particular, a recent trend has seen people using the tool to make videos about chef Gordon Ramsay, with one such popular post seeing him skydiving while cooking spaghetti.Ramsay has not responded to a request for comment.And Cameron is joining the AI industry at a critical time for a different reason - copyright.The technology works by analysing human-made pictures, including images found online, and artists claim this means their work has been used without permission.Stability AI founder Emad Mostaque has previously told BBC News Stable Diffusion is trained using ""100,000 GB of images"" taken from the internet.Getty Images, which is working on its own AI image generator, is suing StabilityAI over this very thing.

83,"article,features",,How cat memes went viral 100 years ago,Future,"In the age of social media, we're living through a communications revolution. But this isn't the first one, nor is it the first time cats have been at the centre of social change.
It is a fundamental law of media history: as soon as a new communications technology emerges, people will use it to make pictures of cats. And those cat pictures show not only the special relationship between humans and their pets, but the changing ways that humans relate to one another.
Cat memes in their modern form date back to the 1990s, when email first allowed bored office workers and friends to message each other funny felines. The cats jumped from there to social media as the web developed, where viral videos like Keyboard Cat and memes such as Grumpy Cat bloomed across platforms. Demand for this content was so high that entire websites like ICanHasCheezburger sprung up to showcase the best e-cats, aggregating popular pet videos and cat memes.
But there was another trend long before any cat wanted to ""has cheezburger"", or any owner could even imagine taking a video of their pet with a handheld electronic rectangle: the Edwardian postcard. And, according to scholars of media history, understanding the cat postcards of the early 20th Century might help us to understand social media today.
""Some things persist across generations and media, and depictions of cats are one of those things. It's kind of reassuring,"" says Ben Weiss, a senior curator at the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, and co-curator of the museum's The Postcard Age exhibition.
In the 19th and early 20th Century, Weiss says, ""postcards functioned like social media today"". Cheaper, faster and more convenient than a letter, postcards were used to share random musings, plan logistics for where and when to meet, tell jokes and, as always, post cat pictures. Whether it's mail sent with a stamp in 1924 or posts made with the tap of a finger in 2024, cats of all forms have always been there for artists and audiences.
The first postcards were printed in Austria-Hungary in 1869 – fortuitous timing for an innovation in the mail field because in 1874, 21 countries established the Universal Postal Union, allowing mail to be sent and delivered internationally. More countries followed in the years to come, and postcards rode this wave.
Like memes, postcards carried not just a picture and a few lines of text but were tangible evidence of a vast network and powerful institutions that had transported them rapidly across a far distance. They marked a changing world and technology's startling advance, delivered daily into the hands and mailboxes of citizens.
""We've forgotten the density of that early 20th-Century communications network, which postcards were moving through,"" says Weiss. ""You could send a postcard to someone at 10 saying you'll be there at 5:30, if you're going from Manhattan to Jersey City, and you can get the message to them fairly quickly.""
Postcards in the early 20th-Century city arguably marked the first time in history that communication at that speed was affordable and widely accessible to the average person. Between 1900 and 1914, says Weiss, ""there's this massive worldwide postcard craze to the point where people talk about it being a disease in the public bloodstream"".
During this era of postcard mania, uncountable millions of postcards circulated, and it was a perfect moment for cats to take over the new medium. At the time cats were considered more than just pest control. Monarchs and socialites, including Queen Victoria, were famous cat enjoyers, and the animal's association with Halloween was well-established. Some postcards featured cats just being cats: sipping milk from saucers, playing with yarn, basking in the sunlight. Others dressed cats up as humans, working jobs and taking part in domestic scenes.
Not everybody was comfortable with the postcard's impact on society. Newspapers called it a ""fresh terror"" and a ""Frankenstein's monster"", alarmed by the product's popularity, says Monica Cure, author of Picturing the Postcard: A New Media Crisis at the Turn of the Century. The sacks of postal workers swelled with postcards, leading to stories about injuries from lifting overladen mail bags.
""Postcards were seen as so fast,"" Cure says. ""There were lots of complaints about what postcards were going to do to people's reading and writing skills, because if you could just dash off a few lines, why did you need to actually learn grammar and become a good writer?""
People also feared the postcard would lead to more superficial relationships, because instead of writing pages to each other in letters, people were just sending pictures back and forth. The public, unsealed nature of postcards was also frightening to many people, Cure says. The first and earliest proposal for the postcard was actually shot down because ""it was just too scary to have something where servants can read your mail"".
Today, similar worries animate the conversations around social media. It's too fast, it's a national security threat, it's leading to shallower thinking. New forms of communication technology unsettle the ways people are used to seeing themselves and their communities, Cure says. New forms of social media also bring new forms of cat.
And like memes today, postcard culture intersected with politics. Some of the most famous postcard cats are associated with the Suffrage movement. Postcards were sold as fundraising for social causes, but postcard-making companies also pounced on any opportunity to make content around issues people cared about.
""Postcards are similar to memes, and much like today, early 20th-Century visual culture was all about animals, especially cats,"" says Heidi Herr, a librarian at Johns Hopkins University, and the curator of the Votes and Petticoats exhibition commemorating the visual culture of the Suffrage movement. Cats were typically associated with the household setting, and ""meant to be passive, beautiful, decorative and demure"", Herr says, but at the same time, cats are predators and anyone who owns one can tell you they like to make use of their claws.
""The Suffragettes were capitalist queens, they were building their brand,"" says Herr. The movement was savvy in the use of new media like postcards and film to get their message out and cats offered potent symbolism.

Ann Lewis, a collector of Suffrage movement memorabilia and former communications director for the Clinton White House, says she was ""enormously impressed"" by the Suffrage movement's political messaging. ""Politics is about communications,"" says Lewis, ""telling people why they should vote for you."" In an era where mass media essentially meant just the newspaper and mail, Suffragettes successfully waged a decades-long campaign to persuade an all-male electorate, and new media was a crucial part of their success. ""Postcards are the email of their day – inexpensive and personal,"" says Lewis.
The Suffrage cat postcards still resonate with a generation raised on cat memes. Herr says stickers the library made of the Suffrage cats are among the most in-demand items on the Johns Hopkins campus. ""I'm already seeing students with these stickers on water bottles and laptops, we gave away reproductions and I see them on dorm room windows. People are all about the cat.""
People are still all about the cat, but people are also all about each other – and whether it's a postcard or a meme, the record of media history shows there's little which interests humans more than sending cute, funny animal pictures.

84,"article,news",,"Sharp rise in problematic teenage social media use, study says",Technology,"A major international study suggests there has been a sharp rise in what it calls ""problematic"" social media use among young people since the pandemic.Researchers came to the conclusion after surveying almost 280,000 children aged 11, 13 and 15 across 44 countries.The Health Behaviour In School-aged Children (HBSC) study found, on average, 11% of respondents engaged with social media in a problematic way in 2022 - compared to 7% in 2018.England, Scotland and Wales all recorded figures above that average.The report's authors say the findings ""raise urgent concerns about the impact of digital technology on the mental health and well-being of Europe's youth"".
They say more action is needed to ""promote healthy online behaviours.""""Problematic use is most common amongst 13-year-olds - it sort of peaks in that early adolescence phase and girls are more likely to report problematic social media use than boys,"" said the study's international co-ordinator Dr Jo Inchley, from the University of Glasgow.She said the research also revealed how much time young people spend online.""Across the study as a whole, we found just over a third of adolescents report continuous online contact with friends and others,"" she said.""That means almost all the time throughout the day they are connected online to friends and other people.""
The report does not conclude all that time spent online is detrimental.Instead, teenagers who were heavy, but not problematic, users of social media  reported stronger peer support and social connections.But for the ""problematic"" minority it found social media use was associated with addiction-like symptoms including:neglect of other activities in favour of spending time on social mediafrequent arguments about uselying about how much time is spent onlinean inability to control social media use and experiencing withdrawalIt also highlights concerns about the proportion of teenagers considered to be at risk of ""problematic gaming"" - something it suggests applies to boys more than girls.That designation applied to 15% of teenagers in England - the second highest proportion across all countries studied.The average proportion of boys who played daily was 46%, but this figure stood at 52% in England and 57% in Scotland.And 13-year-old boys in England reported the highest rate of long gaming sessions, with 45% of boys of that age indicating that they played for at least four hours on gaming days.
The study has been published by the European arm of the World Health Organisation (WHO).Dr Hans Henri P Kluge, the WHO's regional director for Europe, said the findings made clear social media could have both positive and negative consequences for young people.He said there needed to be more ""digital literacy education"" to help young people develop a healthy approach to being online, and governments, health authorities, teachers and parents all had to play their part.""It's clear we need immediate and sustained action to help adolescents turn the tide on potentially damaging social media use, which has been shown to lead to depression, bullying, anxiety, and poor academic performance,"" he said.Ben Carter, Professor of Medical Statistics at the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience, described the report as a “useful snapshot of the evidence"".But he pointed out it was difficult to agree on a definition of what “problematic social media” was, making gathering data on it challenging.Nonetheless, he said the study was a “valid contribution to the evidence base"".

85,"article,news",,CrowdStrike: What was the impact of the global IT outage,Technology,"GPs couldn't treat patients, people were stranded as planes couldn't get off the ground, and small businesses lost much-needed sales.Two months on from the global IT outage on 19 July, its full impact is only now becoming apparent. A rogue software update by the US cybersecurity company CrowdStrike crippled up to eight and half million computers using Microsoft systems around the world.Adam Meyers - a senior executive at CrowdStrike - will testify at the US Congress on Tuesday.He will speak of being ""deeply sorry"" about what happened, and his company's determination to ""prevent it from happening again.""But what was it like for those on the sharp end of the crisis?Dr David Wrigley, a GP for the past 22 years, told the BBC about cancer referrals being delayed as the online systems doctors like him rely on went dark.""It was a very difficult period of time with very little help and support,"" he said.
For many GPs, they were unable to use the EMIS system - a digital way of managing appointment bookings and patient records, as well as sending prescriptions to pharmacies.The British Medical Association - the trade union and professional body for doctors and medical students in the UK - said the CrowdStrike outage was ""one of the toughest single days in recent times for GPs across England"", with doctors forced to return to pen and paper.At Dr Wrigley's practice in Carnforth, Lancashire, computer problems continued between Friday and Monday. He said this created a backlog that delayed urgent tasks such as writing referral letters for patients with suspected cancers.In some cases, this would have been delayed by ""three or four days"".""You have to prioritise those and send them as soon as possible,"" he said. ""All the referrals we do are done electronically - that couldn’t happen.""
Elsewhere, the BMA said there were also major problems in Northern Ireland.Around 75% of GPs in Northern Ireland use the EMIS system according to Dr Frances O'Hagan, the chair of BMA's Northern Ireland GP committee.""We couldn't do anything for most people,"" she said.""We just had to take it on the chin and get on with it.""She said GPs in Northern Ireland faced similar backlogs to colleagues in England, including a delay to suspected cancer referrals. The Department of Health told the BBC it is in discussion with ""external suppliers"" to strengthen ""continuity arrangements"" following the CrowdStrike outage.It says GPs had access to ""local copies"" of patient data from EMIS during the outage, and all other systems worked.
Professor Kamila Hawthorne, Chair of the Royal College of GPs, told the BBC it was ""crucial"" that there should be ""safeguards in place"" in the future.In Surrey, 50 patients who were due to receive radiotherapy treatment on the day of the outage were forced to reschedule. A spokesperson from NHS Royal Surrey Trust said all urgent cases were seen within 24 hours.NHS England did not comment. The UK government told BBC News contingency plans were quickly enacted, and said it is working with NHS England to help prevent similar incidents.On the west coast of the United States, meanwhile, Providence healthcare operates 53 hospitals and over 1,000 clinics.Adam Zoller is in charge of cyber security for the company.He describes the first few hours as ""a catastrophe"" for hospital IT systems, but 80% were fixed in 48 hours.The hospitals did cancel non-emergency procedures, but Adam said ""in large parts patient care was unaffected"".""CrowdStrike could have handled this in a lot of different ways, and I think they handled it as well as they could have.""
Melanie Cree and her husband Alan, from Bangor in Northern Ireland, were due to fly home from Corfu Airport on the day of the outage.Travel operators were forced to cancel thousands of flights across the world - and Melanie and Alan's flight was axed. After being taken to and from the airport several times in the next few days, they managed to fly home on Monday.
Melanie said passengers were given no food, and some ran out of medication.""It totally ruined what should have been our dream holiday,"" she said. ""We have lovely memories, but we came back absolutely shattered. It was complete chaos.""Their provider Tui gave them a £400 voucher.
As Melanie and Alan struggled in Corfu, another UK family were caught up in the delays just over 500 miles (804km) away.Laura and Malcolm Jones were struggling to return home to Pontypool, in south Wales, after a holiday in Rhodes with their children.When they were on the tarmac, the flight was cancelled. Laura told the BBC there was no information, no return of bags, and no plan.They spent 16 hours at the airport before they were taken to a conference centre, where frustrated travellers used tablecloths as blankets.The family paid £560 out of their own pockets to fly back to the UK a few days later. Tui has given them a £600 voucher.""I was looking forward to travelling abroad again after Covid, but I think I might just stick going to west Wales for a few years,"" Laura joked.In a statement, Tui apologised to its customers.
But the travel company was not the only one with problems. Delta Airlines in the United States faced a huge impact.It cancelled around 7,000 flights over five days, faces an investigation from the US authorities and is involved in several legal actions.
Back in the UK, small business owner Dawn Watts from Market Drayton, Staffordshire was caught up in the outages in a different way - her website, which provides supplies to cleaning companies and hotels, was out of action.She estimates to have lost about £600 in sales.""It is extremely worrying,"" she said. ""I am a sole trader - I can’t have this happening again.""
Hannah Al-Khaldi, who runs a boutique fitness studio in London, faced similar issues with a non-functional website.She estimates the outage cost her £1,000.""It showed how many systems worldwide had put their eggs in one basket,"" she said.""When one link in the chain fails, everything else goes down. ""Is there enough choice out there for providers, or was CrowdStrike the only option?""

86,"article,features",,The feud that brought electricity to New York,Future,"When electricity was first rolled out in New York in the late 19th Century, sparks flew between competitors. Today, the city is attempting to complete its electric evolution.
On 7 June 1882, the lights were switched on in a lush Madison Avenue brownstone mansion, making it the first private residence in New York to be illuminated only by electricity.
Inventor and electricity pioneer Thomas Edison and his colleagues had installed wiring throughout the walls of the house, which belonged to financier and investment banker J P Morgan. Incandescent lightbulbs had been added to every room – 385 in total.
In the cellar beneath a nearby stable, a steam engine, boiler and electrical generators clanked and roared away, writes historian Jill Jones in her 2004 book Empires of Light. Connected to the house via underground cables, these were manned by an expert engineer, who started duty at 3pm and finished at 11pm. Sometimes, when the family forgot to watch the clock, they would be suddenly plunged into darkness at this point, Herbert Satterlee, Morgan's son-in-law, later wrote.
The Morgan's neighbour, Mrs James Brown complained the machines made her whole house vibrate. Morgan, though, was reportedly pleased.
But this milestone was just a test run for Edison. ""Edison didn't want to build small, separate generators in millionaires' basements; he wanted infrastructure to feed the whole city,"" writes historian Alice Bell in her 2021 book Our Biggest Experiment: A History of the Climate Crisis. ""Indeed, the beauty of electricity was that you could distance yourself from the dirt of the generation of power.""
While electricity had been known about and studied for millennia, it was only from around 1800 that it emerged as a potentially viable energy source.
In the late 19th Century, New York State and in particular New York City became a global epicentre of emerging ideas on how electricity could be used in everyday life, and the experiments to roll out the first electricity systems to the public.
As the scene of some of the world's first power plants, street lighting and power networks, as well as an infamous ""war of the currents"", New York played a pivotal role in the rollout of what electrical systems look like today.
""New York City was the first place where commercial electricity was built and sold at scale in the US,"" says Robert Lifset, associate professor of history at the University of Oklahoma who specialises in the energy history of the US – although there were ""quite a few"" controversies that took time to be resolved, he adds.
At the time of these early experiments, electricity remained a strange, relatively new curiosity to most people. The thought of using electricity to power our entire lives was still a distant, rather odd idea. Today, it has become one of the most important ways we know of to avoid more carbon emissions.
Speaking at a recent summit on the future of energy and economy in Syracuse, New York on the future of energy and economy, New York governor Kathy Hochul said she draws inspiration for the current energy transition to clean energy from the advent of electricity in the state. ""So many places looked in awe at us at that time,"" she said. ""Today we're called to do something not unsimilar to the challenges they faced as they tried to figure out how to power the industrial revolution.""
But to understand New York's long and bumpy road to electrification, you need to know how it all began.
By 1880, while some homes were lit by electricity, they were rare and, like J P Morgan's, required individual generators. In fact, gas was more commonly used for lighting in New York. ""Manufactured gas – essentially the gas produced by heating coal – was being piped to the wealthier parts of the city, lit and used for illumination,"" says Lifset.
But the city was already eager for a better alternative to gas, says Harold Wallace, curator of the electricity collections at the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History in Washington DC. ""Politicians are complaining about companies that aren't maintaining their systems well, users are complaining about odours and impure gases that are being used, and there's a lot of calls for something to replace, or at least provide competition for, the gas systems,"" he says.
An enthusiastic group of engineers and inventors centred in New York were eyeing this opportunity. The sheer size and density of New York, already a very populous city, provided an incredibly handy backdrop for field tests on electricity networks. ""Being able to test at scale in New York City was really advantageous,"" says Wallace. ""[Edison and his team] figure if they can make the system work in New York, then they should be able to scale it down, basically, and make it work in other markets.""
Another reason New York City was such an important early hub for the development of electric power systems was its stature as a finance centre, adds Wallace. ""[It was] a locus for investors and what we today would call venture capital.""
First came experiments in arc lighting which could light up huge areas of streets with blinding light. Invented in the early 1800s, arc lamps produce light by passing a high current across a gap between two conducting electrodes, usually carbon rods. New York installed arc lights on towers in the 1860s; and in 1880 a huge array of arc lighting was installed two miles down Broadway, gaining it its moniker, ""The Great White Way"".
But the dazzling arc light was too bright for use in homes, and for some, too bright to use anywhere. New York's real field test was still to come.
The inventor Thomas Edison had gained widespread fame with his inventions of an improved telegraph and telephone, as well as the phonograph, the first device to play back recorded sound. In 1878, he saw arc lights for the first time and quickly became obsessed with the potential for rolling out electric lighting more widely, writes Bell.
In 1879, he announced that he had invented the first practical incandescent lightbulb – which avoided the intense brightness of arc lights – at his research laboratory in Menlo Park, New Jersey.
Dynamos, or self-excited generators, invented around 1870, now existed which could put out a ""tremendous amount of electric power"", sufficient to power arc lights and other high-power electrical systems, says Wallace. The components of domestic lighting were ready for use.
Edison had opened a small coal-fired power station, the world's first to generate electricity for public use, in London in early 1882. But New York was his real focus. After his trial run at Morgan's house in June 1882, in September of the same year the Edison Illuminating Company opened its Pearl Street station in lower Manhattan, widely credited as being the world's first commercial power station.
It featured six coal-powered generators using several miles of cables laid under the street. These under-street cables gave an advantage over the hated muddle of overhead wires starting to criss-cross New York, although installing them did require the temporary inconvenience of closing off streets.
The station provided electricity to homes at a price comparable to gas, and by 1883 had over 500 customers. ""Customers around Pearl Street were given the special introductory offer of a box of lightbulbs for free, and block by block, the lightly twinkling electric-lit cityscape we are now so familiar with emerged from the shadows,"" writes Bell.
Edison was adamant that he was creating a lighting system, not a general overall electrical system, which evolved later, says Wallace. But he did want to make sure it was competitive with gas, he adds, coming up with a figure of a 16-candlepower output, so as to top the 15-candlepower he had surveyed as the average light produced by a gas jet in New York City.
Edison had plans to expand his system throughout Manhattan and New York City, says Wallace. As the Pearl Street station used purely direct current (DC), though, it could only power homes within around a quarter mile radius, he says. This is because the voltage of DC could not be easily converted at the time, making it hard to transmit DC at high voltages, thus meaning DC electricity would see large losses over long distances.
A larger DC network would therefore require many small stations. ""Edison was going to put a series of these stations throughout Manhattan,"" says Wallace.
While working for Edison, the charismatic Serbian-American scientist Nikola Tesla had proposed using a different electricity system based on alternating current (AC). ""With alternating current, you can transmit the power over much further distances,"" says Wallace. ""You can have a few much larger power stations."" AC could be more easily converted between high and low voltages using transformers, which only work on AC electricity.
But Edison dismissed the proposal, arguing his more established DC was safer than the experimental AC which had ""no future to it"". Tesla soon quit and teamed up with railway entrepreneur George Westinghouse, who was also interested in the ability of AC generators to transport electricity over long distances.
Soon Westinghouse and Edison were head to head in the notorious war of the currents, with Edison attempting to discredit AC. The bitter feud included a series of patent suits, a booklet publicly issued by Edison warning about the dangers of AC, and public electrocutions of stray animals using AC in an attempt to demonstrate its danger. Edison also advised the New York State Death Commission that AC was the best choice for human electrocution (the reality is that it's complicated to answer which is more unsafe).
By 1891, though, there were almost 1,000 AC central stations across the US, five times the number of Edison stations. A huge win for the AC proponents was its winning bid to provide electricity for the 1893 Chicago World's Fair, also known as the World's Columbian Exposition. Westinghouse undercut the bid from Edison's General Electric, a huge chance to publicise and demonstrate the competence of AC.
AC's dominance was solidified that same year: after much wrangling, the Niagara Falls Power Company gave Westinghouse (using Tesla's all-important AC patents) the contract to generate power from a new hydro plant being built at Niagara Falls.
This was to be the world's first large-scale hydroelectric power plant. ""The two Niagara stations would generate a mind-boggling 100,000 horsepower, equal to all the central stations then operating in America,"" writes Jones. ""Never had electricity been generated on such a scale.""
In 1895, a 26-mile (42km) AC line was energised from Niagara to Buffalo and began supplying electricity for the city's bulbs, industry and streetcars. Buffalo would soon become the first American city to have widespread electric lighting, earning it the name the ""City of Light"".
The war of the currents was hugely important in determining the future of electrical systems, according to Lifset. ""The switch to AC power allowed for the use of larger power plants located further away from their customers,"" he says. ""This served as the foundation for the industry's emerging business model. It's what allowed electricity to become cheap and was a significant factor in the spread of electrification.""
Over the following decades, electrification swept through New York. Early adopters included commercial businesses looking to attract customers, the wealthy and the city itself, says Lifset. ""Industry was not far behind. It took longer for middle and working-class people to get access."" By 1899, though, anyone in Manhattan could connect to electricity.
Electricity also spread out further afield, although not to everyone. ""Most urban landscapes in the US were electrified by the 1910s,"" says Lifset. ""[But] it took considerably longer for this process to play out in rural America.""
Edison, Westinghouse and Tesla had proven that electricity was a game changer for lighting. But it wasn't the end for gas. ""The gas industry went back, they upgraded their systems, they came up with new refinements so they could put out cleaner gas that didn't have the smell or create quite as much soot,"" says Wallace. ""They also came up with new applications."" The industry began promoting gas for cooking, heating and even refrigerators.
Electricity also soon expanded to more than lighting. ""Very quickly within the 1880s other applications occur,"" says Wallace, including electric fans and irons as well as larger items like refrigerators and stoves. ""[Electric refrigerators and stoves] take quite a bit more of an investment, so most people couldn't afford them early on, but they could afford an electric fan, or especially an electric iron was marketed very heavily early on.""
Since most tenements or apartment homes had only a single light bulb socket hanging in the middle of the room, these early irons and fans would have light bulb bases that could be attached to an adapter and plugged into this socket, says Wallace. ""It was not until the late 1890s, into the early 1900s, when what they called convenience outlets, [what] we think of as wall sockets today, first really started coming on the market.""
Electricity has long reached dominance in the industrial world for lighting and most appliances. But when it comes to heating and transport, fossil fuels remain the principal player.
What's more, while some electricity comes from renewables like hydropower, as it did in Buffalo in the late 19th Century, most comes from coal and gas generating stations. Even today, fossil fuels account for the majority of electricity generation in New York State, in the US and around the world.
So in the current era of climate crisis, New York, like the rest of the world, is facing another energy transition: the move from fossil fuel to renewable energy. A huge piece of the puzzle in how to do this is further electrification of our energy use – in particular, heat and transport.
More like this: 
In May 2023, New York became the first state in the US to ban natural gas and other fossil fuels in most new buildings from 2026. By 2029, taller new buildings will have to do the same. That means electric devices, such as heat pumps, electric heaters and induction ovens, will need to be used for heating and cooking instead of gas-powered ones. The state also aims for all new vehicles to be zero-emissions by 2035.
New York's 2019 Climate Act targets an 85% cut in greenhouse gas emissions on 1990 levels. To help achieve this, it mandates that 70% of electricity should be generated by renewables by 2030 and that all electricity should be zero-carbon – including nuclear – by 2040.
Currently, renewables, largely from hydroelectric plants, provide almost 30% of the state's electricity generation. But half of electricity still comes from natural gas.
It's still not clear if New York will hit its 2030 renewables target, although Hochul has said she remains steadfast in her commitment to the goals. Speaking to delegates at the energy and economy summit, she called on them to take the story of Edison, Tesla and their contemporaries at the beginnings of electricity as a source of inspiration for today's climate action.
""New York state has been an energy pioneer for 150 years…electricity was made here,"" she said. ""[Today], we are called to invest in an emissions-free energy economy… Let's engage, let's strategise and solve these [emissions] problems with the same can-do spirit.""

87,"article,news",,Telegram will now provide some user data to authorities,Technology,"The messaging app Telegram has said it will hand over users' IP addresses and phone numbers to authorities who have search warrants or other valid legal requests.The change to its terms of service and privacy policy ""should discourage criminals"", CEO Pavel Durov said in a Telegram post on Monday.“While 99.999% of Telegram users have nothing to do with crime, the 0.001% involved in illicit activities create a bad image for the entire platform, putting the interests of our almost billion users at risk,” he continued.The announcement marks a significant reversal for Mr Durov, the platform’s Russian-born co-founder who was detained by French authorities last month at an airport just north of Paris.
Days later, prosecutors there charged him with enabling criminal activity on the platform. Allegations against him include complicity in spreading child abuse images and trafficking of drugs. He was also charged with failing to comply with law enforcement.Mr Durov, who has denied the charges, lashed out at authorities shortly after his arrest, saying that holding him responsible for crimes committed by third parties on the platform was both ""surprising"" and ""misguided.""Critics say Telegram has become a hotbed of misinformation, child pornography, and terror-related content partly because of a feature that allows groups to have up to 200,000 members.Meta-owned WhatsApp, by contrast, limits the size of groups to 1,000. Telegram was scrutinised last month for hosting far-right channels that contributed to violence in English cities.Earlier this week, Ukraine banned the app on state-issued devices in a bid to minimise threats posed by Russia.The arrest of the 39-year old chief executive has sparked debate about the future of free-speech protections on the internet.After Mr Durov's detention, many people began to question whether Telegram was actually a safe place for political dissidents, according to John Scott-Railton, senior researcher at the University of Toronto's Citizen Lab. He says this latest policy change is already being greeted with even more alarm in many communities.""Telegram’s marketing as a platform that would resist government demands attracted people that wanted to feel safe sharing their political views in places like Russia, Belarus, and the Middle East,"" Mr Scott-Railton said. ""Many are now scrutinizing Telegram's announcement with a basic question in mind: does this mean the platform will start cooperating with authorities in repressive regimes?""Telegram has not given much clarity on how the company will handle the demands from leaders of such regimes in the future, he added.Cybersecurity experts say that while Telegram has removed some groups in the past, it has a far weaker system of moderating extremist and illegal content than competing social media companies and messenger apps.Before the recent policy expansion, Telegram would only supply information on terror suspects, according to 404 Media.On Monday Mr Durov said the app was now using “a dedicated team of moderators"" who were leveraging artificial intelligence to conceal problematic content in search results.But making that type of material harder to find likely won’t be enough to fulfill requirements under French or European law, according to Daphne Keller at Stanford University’s Center for Internet and Society.“Anything that Telegram employees look at and can recognize with reasonable certainty is illegal, they should be removing entirely,” Ms Keller said. In some countries, they also need to notify authorities about particular kinds of seriously illegal content such as child sexual abuse material, she added.Ms Keller questioned whether the company's changes would be enough to satisfy authorities seeking information about targets of investigations, including who they are communicating with and the content of those messages.""It sounds like a commitment that is likely less than what law enforcement wants,"" Ms Keller said.

88,"article,features",,When robots can't riddle,Future,"AI runs unfathomable operations on billions of lines of text, handling problems that humans can't dream of solving – but you can probably still trounce them at brain teasers.
In the halls of Amsterdam's Vrije Universiteit, assistant professor Filip Ilievski is playing with artificial intelligence. It's serious business, of course, but his work can look more like children's games than hard-nosed academic research. Using some of humanity's most advanced and surreal technology, Ilievski asks AI to solve riddles.
Understanding and improving AI's ability to solve puzzles and logic problems is key to improving the technology, Ilievski says.
""As human beings, it's very easy for us to have common sense, and apply it at the right time and adapt it to new problems,"" says Ilievski, who describes his branch of computer science as ""common sense AI"". But right now, AI has a ""general lack of grounding in the world"", which makes that kind of basic, flexible reasoning a struggle.
But the study of AI can be about more than computers. Some experts believe that comparing how AI and human beings handle complex tasks could help unlock the secrets of our own minds.
AI excels at pattern recognition, ""but it tends to be worse than humans at questions that require more abstract thinking"", says Xaq Pitkow, an associate professor at Carnegie Mellon University in the US, who studies the intersection of AI and neuroscience. In many cases, though, it depends on the problem.
Let's start with a question that's so easy to solve it doesn't qualify as a riddle by human standards. A 2023 study asked an AI to tackle a series of reasoning and logic challenges. Here's one example:
Mable's heart rate at 9am was 75bpm and her blood pressure at 7pm was 120/80. She died at 11pm. Was she alive at noon?
It's not a trick question. The answer is yes. But GPT-4 – OpenAI's most advanced model at the time – didn't find it so easy. ""Based on the information provided, it's impossible to definitively say whether Mable was alive at noon,"" the AI told the researcher. Sure, in theory, Mable could have died before lunch and come back to life in the afternoon, but that seems like a stretch. Score one for humanity. 
The Mable question calls for ""temporal reasoning"", logic that deals with the passage of time. An AI model might have no problem telling you that noon comes between 9am and 7pm, but understanding the implications of that fact is more complicated. ""In general, reasoning is really hard,"" Pitkow says. ""That's an area which goes beyond what AI currently does in many cases.""
A bizarre truth about AI is we have no idea how it works. We know on a high level – humans built AI, after all. Large language models (LLMs) use statistical analysis to find patterns in enormous bodies of text. When you ask a question, the AI works through the relationships it's spotted between words, phrases and ideas, and uses that to predict the most likely answer to your prompt. But the specific connections and calculations that tools like ChatGPT use to answer any individual question are beyond our comprehension, at least for now.
The same is true about the brain: we know very little about how our minds function. The most advanced brain-scanning techniques can show us individual groups of neurons firing as a person thinks. Yet no one can say exactly what those neurons are doing, or how thinking works for that matter. 
By studying AI and the mind in concert, however, scientists could make progress, Pitkow says. After all, the current generation of AI uses ""neural networks"" which are modelled after the structure of the brain itself. There's no reason to assume AI uses the same process as your mind, but learning more about one reasoning system could help us understand the other. ""AI is burgeoning, and at the same time we have this emerging neurotechnology that's giving us unprecedented opportunities to look inside the brain,"" Pitkow says.
The question of AI and riddles gets more interesting when you look at questions that are designed to throw off human beings. Here's a classic example:
A bat and a ball cost $1.10 in total. The bat costs $1.00 more than the ball. How much does the ball cost? 
Most people have the impulse to subtract 1.00 from 1.10, and say the ball costs $0.10, according to Shane Frederick, a professor of marketing at the Yale School of Management, who's studied riddles. And most people get it wrong. The ball costs $0.05.
""The problem is people casually endorse their intuition,"" Frederick says. ""People think that their intuitions are generally right, and in a lot of cases they generally are. You couldn't go through life if you needed to question every single one of your thoughts."" But when it comes to the bat and ball problem, and a lot of riddles like it, your intuition betrays you. According to Frederick, that may not be the case for AI.
Human beings are likely to trust their intuition, unless there's some indication that their first thought might be wrong. ""I'd suspect that AI wouldn't have that issue though. It's pretty good at extracting the relevant elements from a problem and performing the appropriate operations,"" Frederick says.
The bat and ball question is a bad riddle to test AI, however. It's famous, which means that AI models trained on billions of lines of text have probably seen it before. Frederick says he's challenged AI to take on more obscure versions of the bat and ball problem, and found the machines still do far better than human participants – though this wasn't a formal study.
If you want AI to exhibit something that feels more like logical reasoning, however, you need a brand-new riddle that isn't in the training data. For a recent study (available in preprint), Ilievski and his colleagues developed a computer program that generates original rebus problems, puzzles that use combinations of pictures, symbols and letters to represent words or phrases. For example, the word ""step"" written in tiny text next to a drawing of four men could mean ""one small step for man"".
The researchers then pitted various AI models against these never-before-seen rebuses and challenged real people with the same puzzles. As expected, human beings did well, with an accuracy rate of 91.5% for rebuses that used images (as opposed to text). The best performing AI, OpenAI's GPT-4o got 84.9% right under optimal conditions. Not bad, but Homo sapiens still have the edge. 
According to Ilievski, there's no accepted taxonomy that breaks down what all of the various different kinds of logic and reasoning are, whether you're dealing with a human thinker or a machine. That makes it difficult to pick apart how AI fares on different kinds of problems.
One study divided reasoning into some useful categories. The researcher asked GPT-4 a series of questions, riddles, and word problems that represented 21 different kinds of reasoning. These included simple arithmetic, counting, dealing with graphs, paradoxes, spatial reasoning and more. Here's one example, based on a 1966 logic puzzle called the Wason selection task:
Seven cards are placed on the table, each of which has a number on one side and a single-coloured patch on the other side. The faces of the cards show 50, 16, red, yellow, 23, green, 30. Which cards would you have to turn to test the truth of the proposition that if a card is showing a multiple of four then the colour of the opposite side is yellow?
GPT-4 failed miserably. The AI said you'd need to turn over the 50, 16, yellow and 30 cards. Dead wrong. The proposition says that cards divisible by four have yellow on the other side – but it doesn't say that only cards divisible by four are yellow. Therefore, it doesn't matter what colour the 50 and 30 cards are, or what number is on the back of the yellow card. Plus, by the AI's logic, it should have checked the 23 card, too. The correct answer is you only need to flip 16, red, and green.  
It also struggled with some even easier questions:
Suppose I'm in the middle of South Dakota and I'm looking straight down towards the centre of Texas. Is Boston to my left or to my right?
This is a tough one if you don't know American geography, but apparently, GPT-4 was familiar with the states. The AI understood it was facing south, and it knew Boston is east of South Dakota, yet it still gave the wrong answer. GPT-4 didn't understand the difference between left and right.
The AI flunked most of the other questions, too. The researcher's conclusion: ""GPT-4 can't reason.""
For all its shortcomings, AI is getting better. In mid-September, OpenAI released a preview of GPT-o1, a new model built specifically for harder problems in science, coding and maths. I opened up GPT-o1 and asked it many of the same questions from the reasoning study. It nailed the Wason selection rask. The AI knew you needed to turn left to find Boston. And it had no problem saying, definitively, that our poor friend Mable who died at 11pm was still alive at noon. 
There are still a variety of questions where AI has us beat. One test asked a group of American students to estimate the number of murders last year in Michigan, and then asked a second group the same question about Detroit, specifically. ""The second group gives a much larger number,"" Frederick says. (For non-Americans, Detroit is in Michigan, but the city has an outsized reputation for violence.) ""It's a very hard cognitive task to look past the information that's not right in front of you, but in some sense that's how AI works,"" he says. AI pulls in information it learned elsewhere.
More like this:• Can a computer teach you to apologise effectively?• AI took their jobs. Now they get paid to make it sound human• The chatbots that say they can feel emotions
That's why the best systems may come from a combination of AI and human work; we can play to the machine's strengths, Ilievski says. But when we want to compare AI and the human mind, it's important to remember ""there is no conclusive research providing evidence that humans and machines approach puzzles in a similar vein"", he says. In other words, understanding AI may not give us any direct insight into the mind, or vice versa.
Even if learning how to improve AI doesn't reveal answers about the hidden workings of our minds, though, it could give us a hint. ""We know the brain has different structures related to things like memory value, movement patterns and sensory perception, and people are trying to incorporate more and more structures into these AI systems,"" Pitkow says. ""This is why neuroscience plus AI is special, because it runs in both directions. Greater insight into the brain can lead to better AI. Greater insight into AI could lead to better understanding of the brain.""

89,"article,news",,MrBeast is YouTube's biggest star - now he faces 54-page lawsuit,Technology,"Half a billion fans, a multi-million dollar personal fortune and a global business empire.It would take a lot to dethrone YouTube's biggest influencer Jimmy Donaldson, aka MrBeast.But a 54-page court document could be his toughest test yet.Five female contestants on upcoming Prime Video show Beast Games are launching legal action against his production company MrB2024 and Amazon in Los Angeles.Billed as the largest ever reality competition series, 1,000 contestants are set to compete for a $5m (£3.7m) prize when the show airs - or if it airs. The lawsuit has plunged the show into crisis. Among many redacted pages, the legal document includes allegations that they ""particularly and collectively suffered"" in an environment that ""systematically fostered a culture of misogyny and sexism"".It cuts to the core of MrBeast's image as one of the nicest guys on the internet.
I flicked through the document, which includes suggestions that participants were ""underfed and overtired"". Meals were provided ""sporadically and sparsely"" which ""endangered the health and welfare"" of the contestants, it is claimed.In one section where almost all of the claims are redacted from public view, it says the defendants ""created, permitted to exist, and fostered a culture and pattern and practice of sexual harassment including in the form of a hostile work environment"".Back in August, the New York Times spoke to more than a dozen of the (yet unreleased) show's participants, and reported there were ""several hospitalisations"" on the set, with one person telling the paper they had gone over 20 hours without being fed.Contestants also alleged they had not received their medication on time.The BBC has approached MrBeast and Amazon - he has not yet publicly commented.So will these latest allegations hurt the king of YouTube's popularity? 
MrBeast is no stranger to controversy this year - and has managed to come out unscathed each time.In July, the 26-year-old American said he had hired investigators after his former co-host Ava Kris Tyson was accused of grooming a teenager.Ava denied the allegations, but has apologised for ""past behaviour"" which was ""not acceptable"".MrBeast said he was ""disgusted"" by the ""serious allegations"".Later, further allegations about business practices surfaced on an anonymous YouTube channel, claiming to be a former employee. The BBC has not been able to independently verify the claims or this person's identity.Some of his philanthropic efforts - such as building wells in Africa, and paying for surgery for people with reduced sight and hearing - have drawn criticisms around exploitation.""Deaf people like me deserve better than MrBeast’s latest piece of inspiration porn,"" one person told the Independent last year.But his empire continues to grow. The day before the lawsuit emerged on Wednesday, he revealed a team-up with fellow famous faces KSI and Logan Paul - a new food line designed to challenge Lunchables.And as I wrote in an article about his meteoric rise last year, he has made his millions through hard work.His videos are big budget experiences, with his most popular - viewed 652 million times - recreating the Netflix hit Squid Game in real life with a $456,000 (£342,000) prize.Most of his philanthropy is less controversial - including giving away houses, cash and cars - which has worked to create an image of him being one of the internet's good guys.According to his website, he has delivered more than 25 million meals to the needy around the world.People continue to flock to his social channels. In June, he gained enough subscribers to make his YouTube channel the largest in the world.According to stats-checker Socialblade, MrBeast picked up an extra five million subscribers in the last 30 days alone. That’s just one metric - we can’t tell how many people unsubscribed from his channel, for example. What is certain is that the number of people who’ve actively decided to stop watching his videos has been eclipsed by those who’ve decided to subscribe.
He wouldn't be the only YouTuber whose popularity holds through controversy - others have faced far more significant storms than MrBeast, with few facing many consequences outside of a public apology.Logan Paul faced a massive backlash in 2018 after he uploaded a video to his 15 million subscribers which showed the body of a person who had apparently taken their own life.After removing the original video, he shared a less than two-minute apology titled simply: ""So sorry.""Now, he has 23 million subscribers, owns an incredibly popular sports drink, and up until August was the WWE United States champion. He's had quite a few pay-per-view boxing bouts, too. Other high-profile YouTubers, including Pewdiepie, James Charles, and Jeffree Star have all had their own controversies, and got on with their careers after uploading apology videos.A more modern example is Herschel ""Guy"" Beahm, known online as Dr Disrespect, who admitted he sent messages to ""an individual minor"" in 2017.He stressed that ""nothing illegal happened, no pictures were shared, no crimes were committed"" and went offline for two months after posting the statement.His comeback livestream earlier this month attracted more than three million views, despite criticism from other high-profile streamers.Dr Disrespect remains the second-most watched streamer in the US this year, according to Streams Charts.The point is: YouTubers tend to be forgiven quickly.
While MrBeast's fanbase has continued growing, controversy is swirling once again - and his next move could determine his long-term success. James Lunn, chief strategy officer at Savvy Marketing, says the star is ""in an incredibly unique position"" with a ""multi-faceted"" brand spanning many industries.""We are indeed in uncharted waters,"" he says, and ""a proactive approach, addressing the issues transparently and ensuring accountability, could protect his brand"".Brand expert Catherine Shuttleworth says the ""sheer scale"" of MrBeast’s fame may act as a buffer against backlash, but the latest lawsuit could be difficult.  ""When it comes to his business ventures, particularly those targeting families and children - like Feastables chocolate bars or Lunchly - it’s a different story,"" she says. ""Parents, who often hold the purchasing power, tend to be less tolerant of controversies involving safety, fairness, and ethics.""Back in August 2023, when writing about MrBeast, I predicted he would soon take the YouTube crown despite him having half as many subscribers then. He is now facing extra challenges as his fame rises, and a lot of the internet is eagerly awaiting his reply to what is, so far, one side of a complex story.

90,"article,news",,Ukraine bans Telegram use on state-issued devices,Europe,"Ukraine has banned the use of the Telegram messaging platform on official devices issued to government and military personnel, as well as defence sector and critical infrastructure employees.The country's powerful National Security and Defence Council (Rnbo) said this was done to ""minimise"" threats posed by Russia, which launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.""Telegram is actively used by the enemy for cyber-attacks, the distribution of phishing and malicious software, user geolocation and missile strike correction,"" the Rnbo said on Friday.In a statement to the BBC, Telegram said it has ""never provided any messaging data to any country, including Russia"".
Telegram is widely used by the government and the military in both Ukraine and Russia.In a statement, the Rnbo said the ban was agreed at a meeting of Ukraine's top information security officials, the military as well as lawmakers.It said military intelligence chief Kyrylo Budanov had presented credible evidence of Russian special services' ability to access personal correspondence of Telegram users, even their deleted messages.""I have always supported and continue to support freedom of speech, but the issue of Telegram is not a matter of freedom of speech, it is a matter of national security,"" Budanov was quoted as saying.The Rnbo said that those officials for whom the use of Telegram was part of their work duties would be exempt from the ban.Separately, Andriy Kovalenko, head of the Rnbo's centre on countering disinformation, stressed the ban only applied to official devices - not personal smartphones.He added that government officials and military personnel would be able to continue to maintain and update their official Telegram pages.Last year, a USAID-Internews survey found that Telegram was the top social platform in Ukraine for news consumption, with 72% of Ukrainians using it.Telegram - which offers end-to-end encryption - was co-founded by Russian-born Pavel Durov and his brother in 2013.A year later, Durov left Russia after refusing to comply with government demands to shut down opposition communities on the platform.Last month, Durov, who is also a French national, was placed under formal investigation in France as part of a probe into organised crime. His case has fuelled a debate about freedom of speech, accountability and how platforms moderate content.In July, Durov claimed that Telegram reached 950 million monthly active users.Following Ukraine's claims, a spokesperson for Telegram said the company would be ""interested in reviewing any evidence that supports Mr Budanov's claims"", adding that ""to our knowledge, no such evidence exists"".""Telegram has never provided any messaging data to any country, including Russia,"" the spokesperson added.Telegram also said ""deleted messages are deleted forever and are technically impossible to recover"".The firm added that ""every instance of supposed 'leaked messages' Telegram has investigated has been the result of a compromised device, whether through confiscation or malware"".

91,"article,news",,A Tamagotchi comeback? Toy gets first UK store as global sales double,Technology,"Tamagotchi is having a moment - again.The egg-shaped toy housing a virtual pet was one of the biggest crazes of the 1990s.And several attempts to reignite the brand over the years appears to have now paid off for owner Bandai Namco. Global sales more than doubled between 2022 and 2023, it tells the BBC, and Tamagotchi has now opened its first shop in the UK - something it didn't even do when it was 1996's hottest gadget.
Unsurprisingly, the modern Tamagotchi isn't the same thing you would have bought in the 1990s.It still looks the same - a garishly coloured egg with a small digital screen and buttons - but the actual toy has much more functionality.""Now you can connect with friends, you can play on Wi-Fi and download different items, and that's really combating that sense of fatigue that you might have gotten with some earlier models,"" Tamagotchi brand manager Priya Jadeja told the BBC.The virtual pet officially relaunched in the UK in 2019 and has been growing since - with a perhaps surprising mix of players young and old.""When we relaunched, we thought it would be a very millennial-focused relaunch,"" Ms Jadeja says.""But it's being introduced to kids who've never had this sort of device before - it's really exciting to see them embracing it.""
Unlike in 1996, now there are many other virtual pets on the market.For example Bitzee, made by Hatchimals, uses a flexible display that responds to your touch, and reacts to tilt-based movement.Meanwhile Punirunes has a popular feature where you can place your finger inside the toy to ""stroke"" the virtual pet on the screen.And there's also Digimon virtual pets - another 1990s throwback - though these are also owned by Bandai Namco, and were originally designed as Tamagotchi for boys. Despite those gender-based lines being drawn back in the day, Jadeja says there doesn't seem to be any real difference in who buys the toys now.For the Tamagotchi fans we spoke to, nostalgia is playing a big role.
""I got my first Tamagotchi back in primary school, my best friend had one back then and I have fond memories of playing with them together,"" says Emma, known on YouTube as Emmalution. She says she ""started craving some of that nostalgia"".She didn't keep her old Tamagotchi and picked up a modern one last year, she says.""This kickstarted an obsession, absorbing loads of information about all of the releases that had come out after my first ever Tamagotchi,"" she said. ""I started a collection, curious to know what I'd been missing out on whilst I was too busy growing up.""
Koby, known to his fans on YouTube as Lost in Translationmon, agreed.""When I'm playing with my Digimon or Tamagotchi virtual pets, I get a small snapshot of what it was like when I first played with my virtual pets as a kid.""There's also a fantastic sense of community from sharing photos and stories online with other people.""And for Emma, there is one other big factor - escapism. ""With how the world is at the moment, and how it has been for the past few years, it's nice to just look down at your little pixel pet every now and again, forget it all for a moment to feed it a little snack or play a little game, and remember a much simpler time.""

93,"article,news",,The crypto bros who want to crowdfund a new country,BBC InDepth,"Do you look at the possibility of political turbulence ahead of November’s US presidential election and think: democracy could be in trouble? So does a group of tech entrepreneurs backed by big Silicon Valley money. And they love it.Imagine if you could choose your citizenship the same way you choose your gym membership. That’s a vision of the not-too-distant future put forward by Balaji Srinivasan. Balaji – who, like Madonna, is mostly just known by his first name – is a rockstar in the world of crypto. A serial tech entrepreneur and venture capitalist who believes that pretty much everything governments currently do, tech can do better.I watched Balaji outline his idea last autumn, at a vast conference hall on the outskirts of Amsterdam. “We start new companies like Google; we start new communities like Facebook; we start new currencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum; can we start new countries?” he asked, as he ambled on stage, dressed in a slightly baggy grey suit and loose tie. He looked less like a rockstar, more like a middle manager in a corporate accounts department. But don’t be fooled. Balaji is a former partner at the giant Silicon Valley venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz. He has backers with deep pockets.
Silicon Valley loves “disruption”. Tech startups have been disrupting traditional media for years; now they are making inroads into other areas too: education, finance, space travel. “Imagine a thousand different startups, each of them replacing a different legacy institution,” Balaji told the audience. “They exist alongside the establishment in parallel, they’re pulling away users, they’re gaining strength, until they become the new thing.”If startups could replace all these different institutions, Balaji reasoned, they could replace countries too. He calls his idea the “network state”: startup nations. Here’s how it would work: communities form – on the internet initially – around a set of shared interests or values. Then they acquire land, becoming physical “countries” with their own laws. These would exist alongside existing nation states, and eventually, replace them altogether.You would choose your nationality like you choose your broadband provider. You would become a citizen of the franchised cyber statelet of your choice.There is nothing new about corporations having undue influence in the affairs of nation states. The term ""banana republic"" derives from the fact that a US company, United Fruit, effectively ruled Guatemala for decades beginning in the 1930s. Apart from owning the majority of the land, they ran the railways, the postal service, the telegraph. When the Guatemalan government tried to push back, the CIA helped United Fruit out by instigating a coup.But the network state movement appears to have greater ambitions still. It doesn’t just want pliant existing governments so that companies can run their own affairs. It wants to replace governments with companies.
The Coming StormAs the US heads into a presidential election, Gabriel Gatehouse dives back into the labyrinthine rabbit warren of American conspiracy culture. Whilst liberals across the world worry about a possible return of Donald Trump, millions of Americans are convinced that their democracy has already been hijacked – by a sinister Deep State cabal. How did this happen? And who is behind it? That's the story that Gabriel Gatehouse is investigating in this series of The Coming Storm.
There are those who view the network state idea as a neo-colonial project that would replace elected leaders with corporate dictators acting in the interests of their shareholders. But others think it's a way of cutting through what they see as the regulation-infested state of Western democracies today. Sounds like a tech bro fantasy? Elements of the network state already exist.The conference in Amsterdam included tech entrepreneurs showcasing some of these “startup societies”. There was Cabin, a “network city of modern villages” that has branches in the US, Portugal and elsewhere; and Culdesac, an Arizona-based community designed for remote working.Balaji’s concept of the network state builds on the idea of “charter cities”, urban areas that constitute a special economic zone, similar to free ports. There are several such projects under construction around the world, including in Nigeria and Zambia. At a recent rally in Las Vegas, Donald Trump promised that, if elected in November, he would free up federal land in Nevada to “create special new zones with ultra-low taxes and ultra-low regulation”, to attract new industries, build affordable housing and create jobs. The plan would, he said, revive “the frontier spirit and the American dream”.Culdesac and Cabin look more like online communities that have established territorial bases. Próspera is different. Located on an island off the coast of Honduras, it describes itself as a “private city” catering to entrepreneurs. It promotes longevity science – offering unregulated experimental gene therapies to slow the ageing process.Run by a for-profit company based in Delaware in the United States, Próspera was granted special status under a previous Honduran government to make its own laws. The current president, Xiomara Castro, wants it gone, and has begun stripping it of some of the special privileges it was granted. Próspera is suing the government of Honduras for $10.8 billion.
At some point during the day-long pitching session in Amsterdam, a young man in a grey hoodie slouched on stage. His name was Dryden Brown. He said he wanted to build a new city-state, somewhere on the Mediterranean coast. It would be governed not by a giant state bureaucracy, but on the blockchain, the technology underlying cryptocurrency. Its founding principles would be ideas of “vitality” and “heroic virtue”. He called it Praxis, the Ancient Greek word for “action”. The first citizens of this new nation, he said, would be able to move in in 2026.He was a little hazy on the details. Move in where exactly? Who would build the infrastructure? Who would run it? Dryden Brown fumbled with a remote and pulled up a slide, suggesting Praxis was backed by funds with access to hundreds of billions of dollars of capital.For now, though, the “Praxis community” exists mainly on the internet. There is a website where you can apply for citizenship. Who, exactly, these citizens are, is unclear. Dryden flashed up another slide with his remote. It was a Pepe meme: the sad-looking cartoon frog that became an “alt-right” mascot during the Trump campaign in 2016.In this niche world of startup nations, Praxis had a reputation for edginess. They hosted legendary parties: people spoke of candle-lit soirees in giant Manhattan loft spaces, where awkward computer coders mixed with hipster models and figures from the “Dark Enlightenment” – people like the blogger Curtis Yarvin, who advocates a totalitarian future in which the world is ruled by corporate “monarchs”. His ideas are sometimes described as fascist, something he denies. Attendees would be made to sign an NDA. Journalists were generally not welcome.After his presentation, I went to talk to Dryden Brown. He seemed suspicious and a little cold, but he gave me his phone number. I messaged him a few times, trying to engage him in conversation. To no avail.But then, about six months later, I spotted an intriguing notice on X. “Praxis magazine launch. Tomorrow night. Photocopy your favourite pages.” There was no time given, no location. Just a link where you could apply to attend. I applied. No answer. So, next morning, I texted Dryden Brown again. And to my surprise, he replied right away: “Ella Funt at 10pm.”
Ella Funt turned out to be a bar and nightclub in Manhattan. Formerly known as Club 82, it had once been a legendary spot on the New York gay scene; in the 1950s, writers and artists would go there to drink cocktails served by women in tuxedos and watch drag acts in the basement. Now it was hosting an exclusive party for people who wanted to start a new country. And I had somehow got myself an invite. But I was 2000 miles away in Utah. If I was going to make it in time, I had to get on a flight right away.I was actually one of the first to arrive. The place was almost empty, with a few Praxis people laying out copies of their magazine around the bar. I flicked through it: expensive, heavy paper; lots of advertisements for seemingly random things: perfume; 3D-printed guns; one for just… milk. Like Pepe the Frog, milk is an internet meme. In “alt-right” circles, posting an icon of a white milk bottle signals white supremacy.The magazine urged readers to “photocopy pages and paste them around your town” – a kind of analogue memetics. A Xerox machine had been wheeled into the bar for that very purpose.A group of young men walked in, some wearing cowboy boots. They didn’t look like outdoor types though. I got talking to one of them. He introduced himself as Zac, a “crypto cowboy” from Milton Keynes (he was wearing a leather Stetson.)“I kind of represent the American Wild West,” he said. “I feel as though we are at the frontier.”Plenty of people associate cryptocurrencies with scams: highly volatile internet money, the value of which could disappear overnight. But in the world of the “network state”, they love crypto. They see it as the future of money – money that governments cannot control.
The next person I got talking to called himself Azi. I asked for his surname. “Mandias,” he replied with a smile. It was a reference to a sonnet by Percy Bysse Shelley: Ozymandias, King of Kings. Anonymity is an important part of the crypto ethos. I got the feeling no one at this party was giving me their real names.Mr Mandias was from Bangladesh originally, but had grown up in Queens, New York. He was the founder of a tech startup. He believed that, just as the printing press had contributed to the collapse of the feudal order in Europe 500 years ago, today new tech – crypto, the blockchain, AI – would bring about the collapse of the democratic nation state.“Obviously, democracy is great,” he said. “But the best ruler is a moral dictator. Some people call [that] the philosopher king.”
Azi said he was excited to be “on the precipice of what I think is the next renaissance”. But before this renaissance, he predicted a “Luddite movement” against new technology that would destroy millions of jobs and monopolise the global economy. The Luddites would fail, Azi said. Yet he predicted that the transition period to what he called the “next stage” of human societal evolution – the “network state” stage – would be violent and “Darwinistic”.Far from being perturbed by this prospect, Azi seemed excited at the thought that out of the smouldering ashes of democracy, new kings would emerge: corporate dictators ruling over their networked empires.I wandered over to the bar and got myself a drink. There I got talking to two young women who did not look like they were part of the crypto crowd. Ezra was the manager of another nightclub nearby, her friend Dylan was a student. It looked like they’d been invited to add a bit of glamour to what was – essentially – a party of crypto-bros and computer geeks. But they had some thoughts about the whole network state idea.“What happens if you don't have enough employees in the hospital or at the school for the kids?” Dylan asked. “It is unrealistic to start an entire city without any government.” To Ezra, the whole idea seemed dystopian. “We wanted to see what a ‘real’ cult meeting was like,” she said, I think in jest.Just then, Dryden Brown appeared, the co-founder of Praxis. When he went outside for a cigarette, I followed him. The Praxis Magazine was a way to showcase the new culture he was hoping to build, he told me. Praxis, he said, was about “the pursuit of the frontier” and of “heroic virtue”.I doubted Dryden would last very long in a covered wagon out on the prairie. He looked exhausted by it all. I wanted to ask him some pointed questions about the network state project: who would be the citizens of this brave new world? Who would govern it? What was with all the alt-right memes? And – Dylan’s question – who was going to staff the hospitals?But we kept getting interrupted by more guests arriving. Dryden Brown invited me to visit the “Praxis Embassy” the following day. We said our see-you-tomorrows and went inside. The party was getting wilder. Ezra and Dylan and some friends who looked like models were climbing up on top of the Xerox machine. They were busy photocopying – not pages from the magazine, but bits of their bodies. I grabbed a copy of the magazine and left.Back at my tiny Airbnb above a Chinese supermarket, I leafed through it. Alongside the white supremacist memes and ads for guns, there was a QR code. It linked to a short film: a 20-minute polemic against the emptiness of modern life, a lament for a vanished world of hierarchies and heroism.
“You are entertained and satiated,” the narrator intones, “you are seemingly productive. But you are not great.” The voice talks about the “algorithms making you hate yourself and your own civilisation”.At this point in the film, the screen shows an animated figure pointing a pistol straight at the viewer.“Contemporary media proclaims that having any ideals is fascist,” the voice continues. “Everything of conviction is fascist.”Was it an invitation to embrace the label of fascism? This movement seemed to yearn for a specific conception of Western culture - a Nietzschean world in which the fittest survive, where disruption and chaos give birth to greatness.The next day, I stopped by the “Praxis Embassy” – a giant loft space on Broadway. The bookshelves were indeed filled with copies of Nietzsche, biographies of Napoleon and a volume entitled The Dictator’s Handbook. I hung around for a bit, but Dryden Brown never turned up.I left wondering what exactly it was I had witnessed the previous night: was it a glimpse of the future, in which countries like the United States and the UK would collapse into a spider’s web of corporate societies, a world in which you could choose to become a citizen of a cyber statelet? Or were Dryden Brown and his friends just “trolling”, a bunch of tech bros roleplaying as alt-right revolutionaries in order to have a laugh at the expense of the establishment, and enjoy a good party?Might Dryden Brown one day become a CEO-king, ruler of an alt-right franchised empire with outposts dotted around the Mediterranean? I doubt it. But there are moves to promote more autonomous zones, free ports and charter cities. And if democracy is in trouble, the network state movement looks like it is waiting in the wings.Top image credit: Getty

95,"article,news",,What's the point of buying the latest smartphone?,,"Happy new smartphone season to all who celebrate. It’s that time of year again, when the tech giants pull out all the stops to persuade you to upgrade your gadgets.Recently we’ve seen Google launch the latest Pixel 9 handsets, followed by Apple unveiling the iPhone 16.In July, Samsung released the latest versions of its foldable phones, the Z Flip6 and Z Fold6, and Huawei has just upped the ante in that department by unveiling a handset called the Mate XT, in China, which contains two folds, folding the screen into thirds.With smartphone sales slowing worldwide, the marketing messages getting pushed out are increasingly dazzling.
Apple boss Tim Cook promised that the iPhone16 would “redefine what a smartphone would do”, whatever that means. Google product management vice president Brian Rakowski waxed lyrical about the “stunning” design of the “gorgeous” Pixel 9 (whisper it: it still looks a lot like a black rectangle to me).Huawei now has its own consumer brand song, it says in its press material, which “powerfully expresses the pursuit of dreams, highlighting that every breakthrough and success the company has achieved stems from a belief in dreams”.Yes, we are still talking about phones.Both Apple and Google have gone big on baked-in AI features. Google’s new Magic Editor can add AI generated content into existing photos, as well as remove the bits you don’t want (with varying degrees of success, in my experience).Apple Intelligence on the iPhone16 includes ChatGPT-maker OpenAI’s tech being embedded into the digital assistant Siri – which many argue has long been in need of an update.But has anyone actually said that they want all of this stuff?
Mobile phone expert Ben Wood, from research firm CCS Insight, said that while AI features aim to make digital life easier, they’re not necessarily on top of everybody’s wish list.“I think that most people now know what they want from a phone, with one of the most important things being the camera,” he says.The phone designers also know this. The tech spec of every new handset camera is usually an improvement on the previous generation. But even this isn’t a guaranteed sales generator any more.“What is definitely happening is that people are holding on to their phones for longer. Back in 2013 there were 30 million phones sold annually,” adds Mr Wood. “This year it will be around 13.5 million.”There is of course an ongoing cost of living crisis affecting people’s spending decisions. And there’s also an environmental price tag attached to every handset, all of which contain rare elements and precious metals.
In addition, there is a growing trend, especially among parents and young people, to try to step away from smartphones entirely.A number of UK schools are reviewing their smartphone policies, and a few have already opted for an outright ban. Pupils starting at the public school Eton this term were issued feature phones (sometimes, rather unpopularly known as dumb phones), and I have heard of several other institutions, both in the private and state sectors, which are considering following suit.The mobile phone network EE recommends that children below the age of 11 shouldn’t have smartphones at all.Nova Eden leads the north and west London branch of the Smartphone Free Childhood campaign, which urges parents and schools to collaborate to delay the age at which children are given the devices.“We are not anti-tech, we are just pro-childhood,” she says. “We would like to see tech companies develop a child friendly phone, offering only essential features such as calls, messaging, music, and maps, without any additional functionalities.”
Dr Sasha Luccioni, a research scientist at the AI firm Hugging Face, says that so far, this message does not seem to be getting through.“There’s increased talk of ‘digital sobriety’ in the way we build and use technology – but it sounds like smartphone designers are going in the exact opposite direction,” she says.I put this to Apple, Google and Samsung. The latter said: ""Samsung users can choose how they use their Galaxy phones that best fits their needs. For example, digital wellbeing features allow users to select what features they use, when they use them and for how long, such as setting a screen time limit on specific apps they want to restrict.""One company that is listening to the growing calls for reduced phone functionality is the Finnish firm HMD – which still makes basic Nokia handsets. Last month it launched a Barbie-themed phone in collaboration with toymaker Mattel, and I tried it out. The two words I would use to describe it are: functional. And pink.Like most feature phones, it has no apps, no app store, no selfie camera, and only one game. If you want to listen to music there’s an FM radio.CCS Insight forecasts that around 400,000 feature phones are likely to be sold in the UK this year – nowhere near enough to knock the iPhone off the top of the list of the world’s most-sold handsets any time soon, but not a bad market space.I just checked my own screentime over the past seven days, and I averaged around five hours per day, This is admittedly a sobering statistic – but it wasn’t all doomscrolling (honest). My phone is a work tool, it’s also what I use for banking, shopping, directions, health tracking and keeping track of family plans, as well as, yes, gaming and social media.
“I think the thing we always forget is that there's a tremendous amount of benefits from using smartphones,” says Pete Etchells, professor of psychology and science communication at Bath Spa university, who has written extensively about the issue of screen time.“We tend to focus a lot more on the negatives. It's always worth bearing in mind that these are technologies of convenience. They help us. There are some good aspects to them as well.”

96,"article,news",,Google scores rare legal win as 1.49bn euro fine scrapped,Technology,"Google has won its challenge against a €1.49bn (£1.26bn) fine from the EU for blocking rival online search advertisers.The bloc accused Google of abusing its market dominance by restricting third-party rivals from displaying search ads between 2006 and 2016.Europe's second-top court ruled the European Commission - which levied the fine - ""committed errors in its assessment"".The Commission said it would ""reflect on possible next steps"", which could include an appeal to the EU's top court.Google welcomed the ruling: ""We are pleased that the court has recognised errors in the original decision and annulled the fine,"" it said in a statement.""We will review the full decision closely,"" it added.It is a rare win for the tech giant, which was hit with fines worth a total of 8.2 billion euros between 2017 and 2019 over antitrust violations. It failed in its attempt to have one of those fines overturned last week.It is not just in Europe where it is under pressure over its highly lucrative ad tech business.Earlier this month, the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) provisionally found it used anti-competitive practices to dominate the market.The US government is also taking the tech giant to court over the same issue, with prosecutors alleging its parent company, Alphabet, illegally operates a monopoly in the market.Alphabet has argued its market dominance is due to the effectiveness of its products.
This case revolved around Google's AdSense product, which delivers adverts to websites - making Google almost like a broker for ads.The Commission concluded Google had abused its dominance to prevent websites from using brokers other than AdSense when they were seeking adverts for their web pages. It said the firm then added other ""restrictive"" clauses to its contracts to reinforce its market dominance - and levied a €1.49bn fine as a penalty.In its ruling, the EU's General Court upheld the majority of the Commission’s findings - but annulled the decision by which the Commission imposed the fineIt said the Commission had not considered ""all the relevant circumstances"" concerning the contract clauses and how it defined the market.Because of this, it ruled the Commission did not establish ""an abuse of dominant position.""

97,"article,features",,Can a law make social media less addictive?,Future,"New York just passed a law on ""addictive"" social media feeds for children, but some researchers are questioning what that actually means.
New York Governor Kathy Hochul was clear about her opinion of social media earlier this month, speaking at a press conference to announce the signing of two new state laws designed to protect under-18-year-olds from the dangers the online world.
The apps are responsible for transforming ""happy-go-lucky kids into teenagers who are depressed"", she said, but according to Hochul, the legislation she signed off on would help. ""Today, we save our children,"" Hochul said. ""Young people across the nation are facing a mental health crisis fuelled by addictive social media feeds.""
Starting in 2025, these new laws could force apps including TikTok and Instagram to send some children back to the earliest days of social media, before content was tailored by users' ""likes"" and tech giants collected data about our interests, moods, habits and more. The Stop Addictive Feeds Exploitation (SAFE) for Kids Act requires social media platforms and app stores seek parental consent before children under 18 use apps with ""addictive feeds"", a groundbreaking attempt to regulate algorithmic recommendations. The SAFE Act will even prevent apps from sending notifications to child or teenage users between midnight and 6am – practically a legal bedtime for devices – and require better age verification to avoid children slipping through undetected. The second law, the New York Child Data Protection Act, limits the information app providers collect about their users.
""By reining in addictive feeds and shielding kids' personal data, we'll provide a safer digital environment, give parents more peace of mind, and create a brighter future for young people across New York,"" Hochul explained.
The laws are part of growing concerns over the effects of social media on the mental health of young people. US Surgeon General Vivek Murthy recently went as far as calling for warning labels for social media apps, similar to the notices on cigarette packaging. In the US and many parts of the world, young people are facing a mental health crisis, and even big tech employees have acknowledged the harms they've caused some children.
But the science linking social media and mental health problems is far less clear than many assume. In fact, numerous studies have even shown social media can have benefits for teenagers' mental health. It's led some technology analysts and child psychologists to call recent political interventions a ""moral panic"".
Some policy advocates and social media experts also question how easy legislative interventions like the SAFE Act will be to enforce. They say it could set back the much-needed efforts to address the real hazards of social media, such as child sexual abuse material, privacy violations, hate speech, misinformation, dangerous and illegal content and more.
Many studies that do find a link with poor mental health outcomes focus on ""problematic social media use"", where individuals have a lack of regulation over their use of social media. This has been associated with increased prevalence of various forms of anxiety, for example, but also depression and stress. Some studies suggest there is a dose-related aspect at work, where negative mental health symptoms increase with time spent on social media. But other studies suggest such associations are weak or have even found no evidence that pins the spread of social media to widespread psychological problems.
There are some studies that even suggest social media use in moderation can be beneficial in some circumstances by helping to create a sense of community.
Indeed, the US Surgeon General's own advisory on the impact of tech on young people suggests that it has as many positive benefits as negatives. According to the Surgeon General's report, 58% of young people said social media helped them feel more accepted, and 80% praised its ability to connect people with their friends' lives.  
And there is even debate about whether problematic social media use is a growing problem at all. One recent meta-analysis of 139 studies from 32 countries concluded that there was no sign it had increased over the past seven years, apart from in low income countries where the prevalence of mental health conditions tends to be higher.
One problem that crops up regularly is that many of the studies in this area rely upon self-reported mood and usage patterns, which can lead to bias in the data, but also use such a wide variety of methods that they are not easily compared.
But this uncertainty in the science hasn't stopped the drumbeat of concern among child-protection campaigners and legislators. They argue that a precautionary principle is prudent and that more needs to be done to force big tech platforms to take action, with the two new pieces of legislation introduced by Hochul being just the latest move.
""There's a real sense of urgency about it all, that we must seen to be doing something right now this minute to fix the problem,"" says Pete Etchells, professor of psychology and science communication at Bath Spa University, and the author of Unlocked: The Real Science of Screen Time.
""But just because it feels like an urgent problem to fix doesn't mean that the first solution that comes along would actually work.""
Some experts in online safety have welcomed the new laws in New York.
""While New York's legislation is much broader and less targeted on concrete harms than the UK's Online Safety Act, it's clear that regulation is the only way that big tech will clean up its algorithms and stop children being recommended huge amounts of harmful suicide and self-harm content,"" says Andy Burrows, an advisor at the Molly Rose Foundation, set up by the parents of Molly Russell, a UK teenager who killed herself in 2017 after seeing a series of self-harm images on social media – a contributing factor to her death, according to a landmark ruling in 2022 by a London coroner.
Burrows says Hochul's swift actions should be seen favourably compared to the US Congress, which he claims ""drags its feet on passing comprehensive federal measures"".
""The bar is quite low and this legislation only stands out as better compared to the numerous pieces of bad legislation out there,"" says Jess Maddox, assistant professor in digital media at the University of Alabama. ""In terms of states in the US trying to regulate social media, this is some of the better attempts I've seen.""
She praises it for not preventing minors from using social media outright, as a similar plan in Florida is attempting – a measure some worry will cause digital literacy issues and leave children less prepared for the future. ""This does put the onus on social media platforms to do something,"" says Maddox.
The response from social media platforms themselves has been mixed. Netchoice, an industry body that represents many of the major technology companies including Google, X, Meta and Snap, described the New York legislation as ""unconstitutional"" and heavy handed. It warned the laws could even have unintended consequences such as potentially increasing the risk of children being exposed to harmful content by removing the ability to curate feeds and presenting possible privacy issues.
But a spokesperson for Meta, which runs Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, said: ""While we don't agree with every aspect of these bills, we welcome New York becoming the first state to pass legislation recognising the responsibility of app stores."" They pointed to research suggesting the majority of parents support legislation requiring app stores to obtain parental approval, and added: ""We will continue to work with policymakers in New York and elsewhere to advance this approach.""
X, TikTok, Apple and Google, YouTube's parent company, did not respond to the BBC's request to comment for this story.
Laws mandating parental consent on social media have also faced legal hurdles. In February, a federal judge upheld a block on an Ohio law that required parents' permission before kids under 16 use social media.
When the SAFE Act faces inevitable scrutiny, the debate around the science could further dampen it's viability, says Ysabel Gerrard, senior lecturer in digital communication at the University of Sheffield in the UK, who has been studying the online safety movement. ""It takes as its premise that social media 'addiction' is a proven phenomenon, but it isn't,"" she says. ""While there's consensus that platforms are, by their very design, and as profit-seeking endeavours, aimed to be enjoyable for their users and to retain their attention, whether that should be classed as 'addiction' is still under debate.""
But Gerrard says the second piece of legislation, the New York Child Data Protection Act is stronger. ""I've long worried about the loss of control children – well, all of us – have over their data and the lack of knowledge we all have about where it goes,"" she says. She believes the law will require platforms to explain where they're using the data they're collecting, which would be a sea change. ""While I entirely agree with the principles behind this Act, I will be interested to see how it evolves, as it would require platforms to do something they haven't yet managed, and to society's detriment.""
Sam Spokony, a representative for Governor Hochul, declined to comment when contacted for a response to the criticism.
There are those who also fear that the wrong approach to regulating social media platforms could ultimately have longer-term consequences.
While Maddox praises the acts for being better than some other state-level attempts, ""this is where my praise ends as it seems largely unenforceable"", she says. She points out that it's difficult to end ""addictive feeds"" in a single state, and compares it to online age verification laws that have effectively banned access to pornographic websites on a state-by-state basis in the US.
One concern is that verifying that social media feeds have been made less addictive once the law goes into effect is going to be difficult. That in itself will make it hard to enforce.
""In being unenforceable, I could see social media companies pointing to this as evidence they can't or shouldn't be regulated,"" says Maddox.
Another challenge is the many different approaches being taken by different states to regulate children's use of social media. Social media networks often transcend not just state boundaries but also international borders. Many key policy makers are sympathetic to the difficulty of implementing differing local restrictions. And already, this mixture of local laws has given social media companies room to challenge the legislation through the courts in places including Ohio, California, Arkansas.
Maddox fears that if such laws are rushed into place, it can do more harm than good in attempts to protect children online than legislation that has had time to be properly scrutinised.
More like this:
• The one simple change that will improve your media diet in 2024 • US surgeon general wants social media warning labels • Adults and teens turn to 'dumbphones' to cut screen time
""For the short term, we may have done something, but in the long term, nothing will likely happen,"" she says.
She's not alone in that fear. ""I worry that folks in power are wasting precious time on something that is unenforceable,"" says Gerrard.
So do critics of the new legislation see a better alternative? ""Clearly in the long run it will be much better for all involved – and I think that also includes the tech companies – to have a single, well developed federal approach rather than a patchwork of 50 states taking separate approaches,"" says Burrows.
A unified, single approach that is based on evidence, and acts as a global standard would be preferable, say the experts, and the technology industry tends to agree. The nascent world of AI regulation offers models that could be adopted to social media as well. For example, lawmakers are fighting to mandate public algorithm audits to make companies open their AI systems to outside experts. However, it is an approach that still may require a global consensus: the UK, for instance, asks AI model makers to submit their products for analysis by its AI oversight body, but a number of firms have said they wouldn't do so because the jurisdiction is comparatively small.
In the meantime, individual states are pushing ahead with their attempts to protect children from what they might see and feel while using social media, while big tech also is pushing back. It seems clear that the war over the future of social media is only just getting started.

98,"article,news",,Instagram boosts privacy and parental control on teen accounts,Technology,"Instagram is overhauling the way it works for teenagers, promising more ""built-in protections"" for young people and added controls and reassurance for parents.The new “teen accounts” are being introduced from Tuesday in the UK, US, Canada and Australia.They will turn many privacy settings on by default for all under 18s, including making their content unviewable to people who don't follow them, and making them actively approve all new followers.But children aged 13 to 15 will only be able to adjust the settings by adding a parent or guardian to their account.Social media companies are under pressure worldwide to make their platforms safer, with concerns that not enough is being done to shield young people from harmful content.UK children's charity the NSPCC said Instagram’s announcement was a ""step in the right direction"".But it added that account settings can “put the emphasis on children and parents needing to keep themselves safe.""Rani Govender, the NSPCC’s online child safety policy manager, said they ""must be backed up by proactive measures that prevent harmful content and sexual abuse from proliferating Instagram in the first place”.Meta describes the changes as a ""new experience for teens, guided by parents"".It says they will ""better support parents, and give them peace of mind that their teens are safe with the right protections in place.""Ian Russell, whose daughter Molly viewed content about self-harm and suicide on Instagram before taking her life aged 14, told the BBC it was important to wait and see how the new policy was implemented.“Whether it works or not we’ll only find out when the measures come into place,"" he said.“Meta is very good at drumming up PR and making these big announcements, but what they also have to be good at is being transparent and sharing how well their measures are working.""
Teen accounts will mostly change the way Instagram works for users between the ages of 13 and 15, with a number of settings turned on by default.These include strict controls on sensitive content to prevent recommendations of potentially harmful material, and muted notifications overnight. Accounts will also be set to private rather than public - meaning teenagers will have to actively accept new followers and their content cannot be viewed by people who don't follow them.
Parents who choose to supervise their child's account will be able to see who they message and the topics they have said they are interested in - though they will not be able to view the content of messages. However, media regulator Ofcom raised concerns in April over parents' willingness to intervene to keep their children safe online.In a talk last week, senior Meta executive Sir Nick Clegg said: “One of the things we do find… is that even when we build these controls, parents don’t use them.” 
The system will primarily rely on users being honest about their ages, but Instagram already uses tools to verify a user's age if they are suspected to be lying about their age.From January, in the US, it will use artificial intelligence (AI) tools to proactively detect teens using adult accounts, to put them back into a teen account.The UK's Online Safety Act, passed earlier this year, requires online platforms to take action to keep children safe, or face huge fines.Ofcom warned social media sites in May they could be named, shamed or banned for under-18s if they fail to comply with its new rules.Social media industry analyst Matt Navarra said Instagram's changes were significant, but hinged on enforcement.""As we've seen with teens throughout history, in these sorts of scenarios, they will find a way around the blocks, if they can,"" he told the BBC.
Instagram is not the first platform to introduce such tools for parents - and already claims to have more than 50 tools aimed at keeping teens safe. In 2022 it introduced a family centre and supervision tools for parents, letting them see accounts their child follows and who follows them, among other features.Snapchat also introduced its own family centre allowing parents over the age of 25 see who their child is messaging and limit their ability to view certain content.YouTube said in September it would limit recommendations of certain health and fitness videos to teenagers, such as those which ""idealise"" certain body types.Instagram's new measures raises the question of why, despite the large number of protections on the platform, young people are still exposed to harmful content.An Ofcom study earlier this year found that every single child it spoke to had seen violent material online, with Instagram, WhatsApp and Snapchat being the most frequently named services they found it on. Under the Online Safety Act, platforms will have to show they are committed to removing illegal content, including child sexual abuse material (CSAM) or content that promotes suicide or self-harm.But the rules are not expected to fully take effect until 2025.What is the Online Safety Act and how can you keep children safe online?In Australia, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese recently announced plans to ban social media for children by bringing in a new age limit for kids to use platforms.Instagram’s latest tools put more control in the hands of parents, who will now take even more direct responsibility for deciding whether to allow their child greater freedom on Instagram, and supervising their activity and interactions. They will also need to have their own Instagram account.But parents cannot control the algorithms which push content towards their children, or what is shared by its billions of users around the world.Social media expert Paolo Pescatore said it was an ""important step in safeguarding children’s access to the world of social media and fake news."" ""The smartphone has opened up to a world of disinformation, inappropriate content fuelling a change in behaviour among children,"" he said. ""More needs to be done to improve children’s digital wellbeing and it starts by giving control back to parents.""

99,"article,news",,TikTok says US ban would have ‘staggering’ impact on free speech,Technology,"TikTok argued in court on Monday that a US law - which would see it banned unless it is sold by ByteDance - would have a “staggering” impact on the free speech of its US users.The law was prompted by concerns that US users' data is vulnerable to exploitation by China's government.TikTok and ByteDance have repeatedly denied links to the Chinese authorities. The companies sued to block the legislation in early May, calling it unconstitutional and an effective ban on the speech of its 170 million US users.
A panel of three judges heard its arguments at an appeals court in Washington DC on Monday.""This law imposes extraordinary speech prohibition based on indeterminate future risks,"" TikTok and ByteDance's lawyer Andrew Pincus told the court.Concerns around China came up early, with Mr Pincus stating that the firm ""is not owned"" by the country. ""The owner of TikTok is ByteDance Limited, a Cayman Islands holding company,” he said.But Judge Sri Srinivasan responded that the firm was ""subject to Chinese control"".Mr Pincus said the US government does not allege any malfeasance has taken place - and the firm was being punished over the suggestion that there might be issues in the future.But he was challenged on his argument that the law would be an unprecedented ban on a single speaker - and his claim that it would be ""unfeasible"" to divest the US arm of the firm. Judge Ginsberg argued the law is ""an absolute bar on the current arrangement of control"" of the company, not the company itself.He also said it targeted a group of companies controlled by a so-called foreign adversary, rather than TikTok alone.When and why could TikTok be banned in the US?
Jeffrey Fisher, representing creators concerned by the law, said it could impede their constitutional right to work with the editor and publisher of their choice – such as TikTok under its current ownership.TikTok creator Tiffany Cianci, who is not among the creators involved in the lawsuit, was livestreaming outside the hearing to update viewers on proceedings.She told the BBC that 65,000 people tuned into her TikTok Live.""The American people care about this issue,"" she said. ""They're tuning in because they're worried about losing something.""
Ms Cianci added that the platform's use by politicians in the run-up to the 2024 presidential election felt ""hypocritical"" and made her doubt the security concerns at the heart of the controversial law.""If it were dangerous, they wouldn't be there,"" she said.Department of Justice lawyer Daniel Tenny argued against TikTok's defence that the code behind its platform is based in the United States.""There’s really no dispute here that the recommendation engine is maintained, developed, and written by ByteDance rather than TikTok US,"" he said.""It is not expression by Americans in America - it is expression by Chinese engineers in China.""Mr Fisher had claimed posts on the platform in the US were American speech that was ""at most curated by a foreign company"".In addition to data concerns, officials and lawmakers have expressed alarm at the prospect of TikTok being used by the Chinese government to spread propaganda to Americans.However, advocates of America's powerful free speech rights, enshrined in the First Amendment of the US Constitution, have said upholding the divest-or-ban law would be a gift to authoritarian regimes everywhere.Xiangnong Wang, a staff attorney at Columbia University's Knight First Amendment Institute, said repressive regimes worldwide may use it to ""justify new restrictions on their own citizens’ right to access information, ideas, and media from abroad.""
But according to James Lewis, of the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, the law was drafted to withstand judicial scrutiny.""The substance of the case against TikTok is very strong,"" Mr Lewis said. ""The key point is whether the court accepts that requiring divestiture does not regulate speech.""Mr Lewis added that the courts usually defer to the president on national security matters.Regardless of how the appeals court rules, most experts agree the case could drag on for months, if not longer.Gautam Hans, clinical professor of law at Cornell Law School, told the BBC he believes an appeal is likely either way.The government's ability to legislate and regulate where national security is concerned is ""paramount,"" he said. ""They cannot have that limited by the courts.""But the issues are also ""existential"" for TikTok, he added, with the company saying it cannot divest and would as such have no choice but to shut down. Mike Proulx, vice president and research director at analysis firm Forrester, added the ""high stakes"" case would likely progress to the US' highest court, the Supreme Court.Additional reporting by Liv McMahon

100,"article,news",,When and why could the US ban TikTok?,Technology,"TikTok is beginning its case against a law which will ban it in the US unless it is sold by ByteDance, its Chinese parent company. The video sharing app has millions of users worldwide, but has faced questions over the security of data and links to the government in Beijing.
Lawmakers from both major US political parties supported a law that bans TikTok unless ByteDance agrees to sell to a non-Chinese company.They fear the Chinese government could force ByteDance to hand over data about TikTok's 170 million US users. TikTok insists it would not provide foreign user data to the Chinese government.In April, following approval by Congress, President Joe Biden signed a bill paving the way for TikTok's forced sale.Previous attempts to block the app in the US on national security grounds have failed.Former US President Donald Trump tried to ban the app when he was in the White House in 2020.But Mr Trump - the Republican 2024 presidential candidate - has criticised the new legislation, arguing that limiting TikTok would unfairly benefit Facebook.Vice President Kamala Harris, who is running against Mr Trump as the Democrat candidate, has used TikTok and popular social media trends like Charli XCX's ""brat"" to try and win over young voters.A spokesperson for her campaign has previously said they would ""just like to see a change in ownership"" of TikTok rather than its ban.
Is TikTok really a danger to the West?Can TikTok's owner afford to lose its killer app?
Mr Biden signing the bill into law did not mean an immediate US ban for TikTok, but it did start a ticking clock. The legislation gives ByteDance nine months to sell TikTok to a new buyer, with an additional three-month grace period, before any ban would take effect.TikTok said this could mean it is either forced to sell or shut down in the US by 19 January 2025, after the US presidential election in November.But the company's fight against the legislation in court, which began when it sued to block the law in May, could take years.
The most straightforward way for the US to ban TikTok would be to remove it from app stores, such as those operated by Apple and Google for iOS and Android devices.
App stores are how most people download apps on to their smartphones and tablets, so the ban would stop new users from getting TikTok. It would also mean that people who already had the app would no longer be able to get future updates designed to improve security or fix bugs.The bill forbids applications controlled by US adversary countries from being updated and maintained in the US. It gives broad powers to the president to limit apps with ties to Russia, China, Iran and North Korea.
Arguments in TikTok's appeal begin in a Washington DC court on Monday 16 September and will be heard by a three-judge panel.A group of TikTok creators who oppose the law over concerns about its impact on their work will also make their case at the hearing.TikTok has previously called the legislation an ""unconstitutional ban"" and affront to the US right to free speech.""We are confident and we will keep fighting for your rights in the courts,"" said TikTok boss Shou Zi Chew. ""Rest assured,"" he told users in a video, ""we aren't going anywhere"".He previously said the bill would give its social media rivals more power and put thousands of American jobs at risk.
ByteDance would also have to seek approval from Chinese officials to sell TikTok, but Beijing has vowed to oppose such a move.
Many US creators and users have criticised the potential ban.Tiffany Yu, a young disability advocate from Los Angeles, told the BBC at a protest outside the White House the platform was vital to her work.
In March 2024, TikTok asked its 170 million US users to contact their political representatives and ask them not to support the bill.But the deluge of ""confused"" calls from TikTok users to congressmen and senators seemingly backfired. Several politicians said the campaign worsened the concerns they had about the app, and strengthened their resolve to pass the legislation.
What could a TikTok ban mean for creators?US TikTok ban would be 'devastating', UK firms warn
It is thought the US TikTok bill could inspire similar moves elsewhere. TikTok is already banned in India, which was one of the app's largest markets before it was outlawed in June 2020. It is also blocked in Iran, Nepal, Afghanistan and Somalia.The UK government and Parliament banned TikTok from staff work devices in 2023, as has the European Commission. The BBC also advised staff to delete TikTok from corporate phones because of security fears.
At the heart of TikTok is its algorithm, a set of instructions which determines which content is presented to users, based on data about how they engaged with previous material. Users are offered three main feeds on their app - Following, Friends and For You.The Following and Friends feeds present users with content from people they have chosen to follow and who follow them back, but the For You feed is automatically generated by the app.This curated feed has become the main destination for users looking for new content, and creators hungry for the millions of views TikTok videos can clock up if they go viral.Critics say the app collects more data than other social media platforms in order to power its highly personalised system.This can include information about users' location, device, the content they engage with and keystroke rhythms they exhibit while typing.But popular social media apps such as Facebook and Instagram collect similar data from users.

101,"article,news",,The Guardian stops posting on Elon Musk's 'toxic' X,Technology,"British newspaper group the Guardian has announced it will no longer post on X, formerly Twitter, saying it has become a ""a toxic media platform"".In a message to readers, it said the US presidential election ""underlined"" its concerns that its owner, Elon Musk, had been able to use X to ""shape political discourse.""Mr Musk strongly backed Donald Trump and has now been given a role cutting government spending in his incoming administration.The BBC has contacted X for comment.The Guardian said users would still be able to share articles and it was likely continue to embed X posts in its coverage of world events.It also said its reporters would be able to carry on using the site ""for news-gathering purposes.""But it said the ""benefits of being on X are now outweighed by the negatives.""""This is something we have been considering for a while given the often disturbing content promoted or found on the platform, including far-right conspiracy theories and racism,"" it added.The decision was also posted on X itself, where some users reacted with vitriol, with those who paid for prominent replies accusing the Guardian of ""woke propaganda"" and ""virtue signalling"".
Mr Musk and the Guardian are far from political bed fellows, so in that sense it is not surprising that the newspaper has responded to his and X's increasing alignment with Trump in this way.But it can also be argued the election result is an opportunity for the paper, which describes itself as ""the world's leading liberal voice.""It is positioning itself as a key part of the ""resistance"" to Donald Trump, using the US election to highlight that is a media organisation without a billionaire proprietor - while also asking its readers for donations.The day after the election, readers pledged more than $1.8m (£1.4m), a record for a single day.Ben Mullin, the New York Times’ media reporter, described the media group’s fundraising as ""a sign that some outlets are tapping a surge of enthusiasm for adversarial journalism post-election"".The Guardian's departure is also likely to intensify questions about whether others will follow.X's rivals already appear to be benefiting.Meta's Threads has continued to expand, and Bluesky - set up by Twitter founder Jack Dorsey - briefly topped the download charts in the UK and US Apple App Stores.Its userbase has grown by four million in two months, and Bluesky said in a post on Tuesday that it had picked up a million new users in the seven days since Trump's win.However it remains comparatively tiny, with 15 million users worldwide.

102,"article,news",,Apple accused of trapping and ripping off 40m iCloud customers,Technology,"Apple is facing a legal claim accusing it of effectively locking 40 million British customers into its iCloud service and charging them ""rip off prices.""Consumer group Which? says the legal action - which it has launched - could result in a £3bn payout if it is successful, equivalent to £70 per customer.Apple has rejected the suggestion its practices are anti-competitive, saying users are not required to use iCloud, many rely on third-party alternatives and insisting it ""works hard to make data transfer as easy as possible.""It is another example of the ""growing tide of large class actions against Big Tech"" which has ""operated without sufficient constraint"", Toby Starr from legal firm Humphries Kerstetter told the BBC.Facebook, Google, gaming giant Steam and the UK's leading mobile providers are among the others facing legal claims at the same court, the the Competition Appeal Tribunal.""Although most of these claims are in their infancy and take a long time to resolve, there will be more decisions coming out over the next couple of years and there will be settlements - these will start to affect the tech giants’ businesses,"" said Mr Starr.
Users of Apple products get a small amount of digital storage for free – and after that are encouraged to pay to use its iCloud service to back up photos, videos, messages, contacts and all the other content which lives on their device.Prices for this storage range from £0.99 a month for 50GB of space to £54.99 a month for 12TB.Apple does not allow rival storage services full access to its products.It says that is for security reasons - but it also contributes to the company's enormous revenues.Which? says over a period of nine years dating back to 2015 Apple has been effectively locking people into its services - and then overcharging them.“By bringing this claim, Which? is showing big corporations like Apple that they cannot rip off UK consumers without facing repercussions,"" the body's chief executive Anabel Hoult said.""Taking this legal action means we can help consumers to get the redress that they are owed, deter similar behaviour in the future and create a better, more competitive market.”Apple has strongly denied Which's accusations.""We reject any suggestion that our iCloud practices are anti-competitive and will vigorously defend against any legal claim otherwise,"" it said in a statement.
Though being launched by Which?, the legal action is being funded and taken forward by international law firm Willkie Farr & Gallagher.Which? said they would be paid fees as the case progressed, getting additional payments if it was successful - but they would not be getting a percentage of any damages. Alan Davis, from law firm Pinsent Masons, said there were very likely to be more, similar cases in the future.""It is inevitable that further claims of this nature will continue to be brought given the very high value of the aggregate damages and the role of and incentive for litigation funders to support these claims which might not otherwise be brought without that financial support,"" he told the BBC.He added the absence of any infringement decisions under EU or UK competition law meant it would be down to the claimant to prove the market abuse it was alleging was actually taking place.However, he pointed out the regulator had announced a wider investigation into cloud services in the UK.

103,"article,news",,'Hospital robot helps me feel like a mum again',"NE, Orkney & Shetland","A mother whose son has been in hospital for more than a year has praised trials of a new technology which dispenses medication and has helped her ""feel like a mum again"".The so-called bedside intelligent cabinet securely stores routine medicines and alerts patients or guardians when it is time to take them.NHS Grampian is describing the trial at Royal Aberdeen Children's Hospital (RACH) as a world first.Kirsty Mair’s son Jacob, 13, has spent the last 16 months in hospital due to the various conditions he has. She said the new equipment takes pressure off staff and helps her feel more part of his treatment, as well as preparing her for his eventual discharge.
Three of the Kinetic-ID machines are being trialled at RACH.NHS Grampian believes the technology can encourage independence and prepares patients for taking medication at home.NHS Grampian's medication safety advisor Lindsay Cameron said: “Self-administration of medicine is about supporting individuals to take their own medication while in hospital.""It’s not suitable for every patient or every medicine, but it can improve patient satisfaction and confidence, encourage independence and self-care in a safe environment, and improve an individual’s knowledge and understanding of their medication.""This can help those already on medicines to continue to self-administer while they are admitted to hospital and others getting used to new medications to feel better prepared when it’s time to go home.""
Kirsty's son Jacob has conditions including Arnold Chiari Malformation.His brain is pushing downwards towards his spinal cord affecting his breathing and swallowing.His mother said she was happy to take part in the trial.
""He has spent most of his life in and out of hospital,"" Kirsty, 39, of Aberdeen, told BBC Scotland News.""Being a parent, obviously when you're at home you've got a set routine for everything - medications, a bedtime routine.""When you come into hospital, some of that is taken away, because you can't obviously get all the medications at the right time, and the staff are in charge of them, it's a hospital and they are so run off their feet.""So since the new cabinet has come on the go and I got asked to trial it, I was more than happy to help. And it's just absolutely brilliant.""If you’re late giving medication it flashes up red.""It takes pressure off the staff, for them and me, because I don't have to go chasing for medication.""
She explained: ""I just feel I'm back being responsible for my own child. So it's really good.""He's on different medications, and medications change. Now I get to do the medications myself, and also learn about the hazards and dangers.""I just feel like a mum again. And it kind of preps me for being discharged which we are close to. I want one for the house.”She added: ""The aim is to hopefully get Jacob home for Christmas. It would mean absolutely everything.""Users and staff will make suggestions during the ongoing trial about how the technology could potentially be improved.

104,"article,news",,Amazon launches Temu and Shein rival with 'crazy low' prices,Technology,"Amazon has launched a new outlet called Haul which caps the price of products on sale at $20 (£15.79), in an effort to take on low-cost retailers Temu and Shein.The online shopping giant unveiled Haul as a mobile-only experience available in its Shopping app for US customers on Wednesday.It says shoppers can expect ""crazy low prices"" on Haul products that are ""worth the wait"" of up to two weeks for delivery.It marks the platform's long-awaited foray into the sale cheaper goods with lengthier shipping times - a business model which has spurred the rise of Chinese-owned e-commerce apps. Bloomberg journalist Amanda Mull told the BBC in July that positioning itself as a competitor to the likes of Temu would be a near-term priority for Amazon.She said Amazon has ""created the spending habits"" of western consumers by acting as a trustworthy middleman between them and manufacturers.But shifting away from its speedy delivery and returns options to echo the practices of increasingly popular Temu and Shein apps would allow them to follow in their footsteps by cutting prices, she said.Amazon has said most of the products on Haul will cost less than $10 (£7.90).It cited examples such as a three-piece razor set and an ""elegant necklace, bracelet, and earring set"" available at just under three dollars each in a press release about the launch.Free delivery will also be available for orders of $25 or over with one to two week delivery.But the mass production of cheap products has come under criticism due to concerns about the impact of their shipping and disposal on the environment.How Temu is shaking up the world of online shopping“Finding great products at very low prices is important to customers, and we continue to explore ways that we can work with our selling partners so they can offer products at ultra-low prices,” said Dharmesh Mehta, Amazon's vice president of worldwide selling partner services.The company says the ""beta"" Haul shopping experience will see all products sold backed by its product guarantees to provide confidence about their safety.Mr Mehta said it was still ""early days"" for its new shopping vertical, and customer feedback would be listened to in order to ""refine and expand it in the weeks and months to come”. The BBC has asked Amazon if, and when, the service will be launched in the UK.

105,"article,news",,Meta fined €798m over 'unfair' Facebook Marketplace,Technology,"Meta has been fined €798m (£664m) for breaking competition law by embedding Facebook Marketplace within its social network.The European Commission said this meant alternative classified ads services had faced ""unfair trading conditions"", making it harder for them to compete.In addition to the fine, it has ordered Meta to stop imposing these conditions on other services. Meta said it rejected the Commission's findings and would appeal.EU antitrust head Margrethe Vestager said Facebook had impeded other online classified ads service providers.""It did so to benefit its own service Facebook Marketplace, thereby giving it advantages that other online classified ads service providers could not match,"" she added,She said Meta ""must stop this behaviour"", with the EU asking the firm to ""refrain from repeating"" the infringement.Meta said the Commission had provided ""no evidence"" of harm either to competitors or consumers.""This decision ignores the market realities, and will only serve to protect incumbent marketplaces from competition.""The ruling is the result of an investigation which the Commission opened in 2021, after Meta's rivals complained that Facebook Marketplace gave it an unfair advantage. 
Meta has not previously faced a fine from the EU over competition rules - though it was told to pay €110m in 2017 for not handing over correct information when it purchased WhatsApp.The Irish Data Protection Commissioner has also previously fined Meta more than €1bn over mishandling people's data when transferring it between Europe and the United States.And it also had to pay a comparatively tiny £50m in 2021, when the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) accused it of deliberately breaking rules over its attempt to acquire Gif-maker Giphy - and ultimately demanded it sell the company altogether.The decision comes as regulators are taking a firmer stance with big tech companies worldwide, with the US government considering a breakup of Google.

106,"article,news",,Outage hits Bluesky just as the platform's popularity takes off,Technology,"The social media platform Bluesky was hit by an outage on Thursday, amid a rising wave of popularity for the app, which is often described as a friendlier alternative to X,.Bluesky has at times been the most downloaded app on both the US and UK Apple Stores in recent days, with many social media users leaving X, formerly Twitter, in the wake of the US election.But on Thursday, some users around the world had trouble getting their feeds and notifications to load.Bluesky spokesperson Emily Liu told the BBC that one of its internet providers “had some downtime, apparently because a fibre cable was out. That means it happened outside of our company"".
Bluesky provided a status notice from Cogent Communications that said some customers using part of its network located between Raleigh and Durham, North Carolina, and Richmond, Virginia, had temporarily lost connectivity.Not all users experienced the outage, which appeared to be largely resolved late Thursday, according to the company. In the week since Donald Trump won the US presidential election, 2.25 million users have signed up for Bluesky, which was started by Jack Dorsey, one of Twitter's cofounders.The key difference between Bluesky and most other social media platforms is that it is decentralized, meaning it is operated on independent servers and not those owned by the company.  Its userbase - while growing - remains relatively small.Many new users have said their decision to join Bluesky was driven by Elon Musk, who heavily backed Trump's election campaign and intends to remain involved in the new administration. Threads, Meta's competitor to X, has also continued to expand. “People are both disgusted and afraid of Elon Musk and what Twitter has become,” said Cory Johnson, Chief Market Strategist at Epistrophy Capital Research. “Users are fleeing X, and Bluesky and Threads are the beneficiaries.”This week, the British news outlet the Guardian announced it will no longer post on X, saying the US election underlined its concerns that Musk had been able to use X to “shape political discourse"".As Thursday's outage unfolded, Bluesky staff tried to make light of the situation, with one developer joking: “Btw — Today will get interesting! If the site goes down, maybe grab a soda, pet the kitty. We’ll hit it with a wrench as fast as we can.”

107,"article,news",,'Amazing showcase' for UK gaming industry cancelled,Technology,"One of the main showcases for UK gaming has been cancelled, reflecting the wider struggles of an industry which has seen a series of job cuts and studio closures.The WASD expo - which is usually held in London in April - is a shop window for British talent, with a particular emphasis on smaller, independent game-makers.But its organiser has now gone into liquidation.Co-founder David Lilley told the BBC ""increasing costs and less demand for stand space means running events is just not viable for us anymore.""There had been speculation about the event's future after the WASD website disappeared from public view months after its 2024 expo took place.But the industry has still reacted with shock and dismay at the confirmation it was no longer going ahead.James Lightfoot, from the UK-based Lightfoot Bros Games, was picked to showcase his game Sleepytime Village at the event this year, and said he was ""so sad to hear it will be no more.""Dave Gilbert, the founder of American independent games developer Wadjet Eye Games, who attended the conference every year, called it ""an amazing showcase for everything the UK game scene has to offer.""
WASD first opened its doors in 2021 as an answer to the closure of EGX Rezzed, an offshoot of the London gaming festival EGX, which focused mainly on smaller, alternative video games and their developers.The expo typically occurred alongside the London Games Festival in April.As well as talks from industry members, WASD showcased a variety of demos from upcoming smaller games, alongside bigger releases such as Street Fighter 6 and Vampire Survivors. David Lilley told the BBC he recognised the importance of the event for the ""indie and creator community"" and wanted ""to take this opportunity to thank everyone who has supported us along the way.""
It comes at a difficult time for in-person gaming events across the UK and the gaming industry as a whole. In September, Insomnia Gaming Festival, the UK's biggest gaming expo, was due to take place in Birmingham, but following a number of lay-offs at its organiser, Player1 Events, tickets never went on sale. Whilst London's other video game showcase EGX did take place this October, it did so in partnership with MCM Comic Con, rather than as a stand-alone event.The past two years have also seen mass lay-offs from some of the industry's biggest companies, such as Xbox makers Microsoft and Sony, which makes PlayStation, following a period of record growth and profits during the Covid-19 pandemic.Rachel Watts, games journalist and co-host of the Indieventure Podcast, believes the announcement is a reflection of a wider movement from companies towards announcing their games online.

108,"article,news",,X users jump to Bluesky - but what is it and who owns it?,Technology,"You may have seen the word ""Bluesky"" popping up on your social media pages recently and wondered what people are talking about.It is an alternative platform to Elon Musk's X and in terms of its colour and logo, it looks quite similar. Bluesky is growing rapidly and is currently picking up around one million new sign-ups a day. It had 16.7m users at the time of writing, but that figure will likely be outdated by the time you read this.So what is it - and why are so many people joining?
Bluesky describes itself as ""social media as it should be"", although it looks similar to other sites.Visually, a bar to the left of the page shows everything you might expect - search, notifications, a homepage and so on.People using the platform can post, comment, repost and like their favourite things. To put it simply, it looks how X, formerly known as Twitter, used to look.
The main difference is Bluesky is decentralised - a complicated term which basically means users can host their data on servers other than those owned by the company.This means that rather than being limited to having a specific account named after Bluesky, people can (if they like) sign up using an account they themselves own.But it is worth stating that the vast majority of people don't do that and a new joiner will most likely have a "".bsky.social"" at the end of their username.
If you think it feels a lot like X, you won't be surprised to learn why. The former head of Twitter, Jack Dorsey, created it.He even once said he wanted Bluesky to be a decentralised version of Twitter that no single person or entity owns.But Mr Dorsey is no longer part of the team behind it, having stepped down from the board in May 2024.He deleted his account altogether in September.It is now run and predominantly owned by chief executive Jay Graber as a US public benefit corporation.
Bluesky has been around since 2019, but it was invitation-only until February of this year. That let the developers deal with all the kinks behind-the-scenes, to try and stabilise it before opening the doors to the wider public.The plan has worked, somewhat. But the flurry of new users has been so significant in November that there continue to be issues with outages.
It is no coincidence that the number of new Bluesky users spiked following Donald Trump's success in the US elections in November.X's owner, Mr Musk, was a big backer of Trump during his campaign, and will be heavily involved in his administration.Inevitably, this has led to a political division, with some people leaving X in protest.But others have cited different reasons, such as the Guardian newspaper which has chosen to stop posting there as it called X ""a toxic media platform"".Meanwhile, Bluesky's app continues to pick up significant downloads worldwide and on Thursday was the top free app in the Apple App Store in the UK.Several celebrities, from pop singer Lizzo to Taskmaster's Greg Davies, have announced they are joining the platform and limiting their use of - or in some cases leaving altogether - X.Other names you might recognise include Ben Stiller, Jamie Lee Curtis and Patton Oswalt.But this growth, while significant, will have to continue for a long time before Bluesky is able to mount a true challenge to its microblogging rival.X does not share its total user numbers but it is understood to be measured in the hundreds of millions, with Elon Musk previously saying the platform had 250 million users each day.
It is the million dollar question, quite literally.Bluesky started off with funding from investors and venture capital firms and has raised tens of millions of dollars through these means.But with so many new users, it is going to have to find a way to pay the bills.Back in Twitter's heyday, the site made the vast majority of its money through advertising. Bluesky has said it wants to avoid this. Instead, it said it will continue to look into paid services, such as having people pay for custom domains in their username.That sounds complicated but it basically comes down to a person's username being even more personalised.For example, it may mean my username - @twgerken.bsky.social - could in the future be more official-sounding, such as @twgerken.bbc.co.uk.Proponents of this idea say it doubles-up as a form of verification as the organisation which owns the website would have to clear its use.If Bluesky's owners continue to avoid advertising, they may inevitably have to look to other broader options, such as subscription features, as a way of keeping the lights on.But if it is not making very much money, that would not be unusual for tech startups.In fact, Twitter, before it was purchased by Mr Musk in 2022, only made a profit twice in its eight years of being publicly traded.And we all know how that ended - a massive payday for investors when the world's richest man paid $44bn (£34.7bn) for the privilege of owning it.For now, the future of Bluesky remains unknown, but if its growth continues, anything is possible.

109,"article,news",,Elon Musk adds Microsoft to lawsuit against ChatGPT-maker OpenAI,Technology,"Elon Musk has stepped up his ongoing feud with ChatGPT-maker OpenAI with a revived lawsuit against the firm, adding Microsoft as a defendant.Mr Musk, a co-founder of the artificial intelligence (AI) company, accused it and the tech giant of operating a monopoly in an amended legal complaint on Thursday.It follows previous lawsuits accusing the firm of breaching the principles he agreed to when he helped found it in 2015.Microsoft declined to comment on the lawsuit.
An OpenAI spokesperson said Mr Musk's refreshed complaint was ""baseless"".""Elon’s third attempt in less than a year to reframe his claims is even more baseless and overreaching than the previous ones,"" they told the BBC.They added that previous emails sent by Mr Musk, which it shared publicly in response to his original lawsuit, ""speak for themselves"".Thursday's legal filing amends a lawsuit filed in a California court in August, and also includes LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman being added as a defendant. The BBC has approached Mr Hoffman for a response.The lawsuit accuses OpenAI of having transformed from a ""tax-exempt charity to a $157bn (£124bn) for-profit, market-paralysing gorgon"".It also claims Microsoft and OpenAI used a monopoly to eliminate competitors in the AI sector - including Mr Musk's own company, xAI.""As a result of their unlawful actions, defendants have been unjustly enriched to the tune of hundreds of billions of dollars in value, while Mr Musk has been conned along with the public,"" it says.
OpenAI was founded in 2015 with the aim of building an  artificial general intelligence (AGI) - generally taken to mean AI that can perform any task a human being is capable of.In 2019, the firm announced a new ""capped profit"" structure allowing it to raise money.Microsoft made an initial $1bn investment into OpenAI shortly thereafter - increasing this to a multi-year, multi-billion dollar partnership in 2023. The lawsuit also accuses boss Sam Altman - a named defendant in the lawsuit - of ""rampant self-dealing"".Mr Musk's initial legal action filed in March argued the agreement had transformed it into ""a closed-source de facto subsidiary"" of the PC giant.OpenAI denied his claims, countering that Mr Musk had previously backed the idea of a for-profit structure. It said in a blog post on its website that the billionaire had at one point wanted ""absolute control"" of the company.The renewed claims by Mr Musk come the same week that US President-elect Donald Trump has picked him for a role in government cost-cutting, as part of his drive to ""dismantle"" bureaucracy when he returns to the White House next year.

110,"article,news",,Digital hub opens to train teachers in new tech,Northamptonshire,"A digital hub that aims to bring teachers up to speed with the latest technologies and create immersive learning experiences has opened.Tresham College in Kettering, Northamptonshire, officially unveiled its Digital Innovation Hub this week.The facility features virtual reality (VR) stations, augmented reality (AR) equipment, 3D printing machinery, robots and interactive displays.Yiannis Koursis, chief executive of The Bedford College Group, said the hub would give teachers a ""safe space"" to learn the latest technologies.
""Teachers can experiment and learn different technologies to enhance the way we teach students,"" he said.""It's things like being able to use VR and AR to look into the heart and how the heart is working, so it's really exciting.""
The hub, which has been paid for through college reserves, will be managed by Mark Tinney, who will run workshops and sessions to show how the technologies can be used in lessons.
""One of the problems that a lot of schools and colleges have is spending a lot of money on buying equipment and [then] getting teachers to use it, and it having an impact on teaching,"" Mr Tinney said.""Training them on how to use it isn’t enough; we've got to follow that through, and that's what this space is intended to do.""The innovation centre was developed in collaboration with Cisco, a company offering IT and consulting services.

111,"article,news",,Roblox to ban young children from messaging others,Technology,"Roblox has announced it will block under-13s from messaging others on the online gaming platform as part of new efforts to safeguard children.Child users will not be able to send direct messages by default unless a verified parent or guardian gives them permission.Parents will also be able to view and manage their child's account, including seeing their list of online friends, and setting daily limits on their play time.Roblox is the most popular gaming platform for eight to 12 year olds in the UK, according to Ofcom research, but it has been urged to make its experiences safer for children.
The company said it would begin rolling out the changes from Monday, and they will be fully implemented by the end of March 2025. It means young children will still be able to access public conversations seen by everyone in games - so they can still talk to their friends - but cannot have private conversations without parental consent.Matt Kaufman, Roblox's chief safety officer, said the game is played by 88 million people each day, and over 10% of its total employees - equating to thousands of people - work on the platform's safety features.""As our platform has grown in scale, we have always recognised that our approach to safety must evolve with it,"" he said.Besides banning children from sending direct messages (DMs) across the platform, it will give parents more ways to easily see and manage their child's activity. Parents and guardians must verify their identity and age with a form of government-issued ID or a credit card in order to access parental permissions for their child, via their own linked account.But he acknowledged identity verification is a challenge being faced by a lot of tech companies, and called on parents to make sure a child has the correct age on their account. ""Our goal is to keep all users safe, no matter what age they are,"" he said.""We encourage parents to be working with their kids to create accounts and hopefully ensure that their kids are using their accurate age when they sign up.""
Roblox also announced it planned to simplify descriptions for content on the platform.It is replacing age recommendations for certain games and experiences to ""content labels"" that simply outline the nature of the game.It said this meant parents could make decisions based on the maturity of their child, rather than their age. These range from ""minimal"", potentially including occasional mild violence or fear, to ""restricted"" - potentially containing more mature content such as strong violence, language or lots of realistic blood.By default, Roblox users under the age of nine will only be able to access ""minimal"" or ""mild"" experiences - but parents can allow them to play ""moderate"" games by giving consent.But users cannot access ""restricted"" games until they are at least 17-years-old and have used the platform's tools to verify their age.It follows an announcement in November that Roblox would be barring under-13s from ""social hangouts"", where players can communicate with each other using text or voice messages, from Monday.It also told developers that from 3 December, Roblox game creators would need to specify whether their games are suitable for children and block games for under-13s that do not provide this information.The changes come as platforms accessed and used by children in the UK prepare to meet new rules around illegal and harmful material on their platforms under the Online Safety Act.Ofcom, the UK watchdog enforcing the law, has warned that companies will face punishments if they fail to keep children safe on their platforms. It will publish its codes of practice for companies to abide by in December.

112,"article,features",,How robotaxis are trying to win passengers' trust,Future,"Autonomous vehicles are already clocking up millions of miles on public roads, but they face an uphill battle to convince people to climb in to enjoy the ride.
A few weeks ago, I took a tour of San Francisco in one of Waymo's self-driving cars. As we drove around the city, one thing that struck me was how comfortable people had become with not seeing a driver. Not only were there multiple driverless vehicles on any given street at any given time, but tourists no longer had their mouths agape as one drove by. The technology has become a familiar sight.
Inside the vehicle itself, there were signs of how Waymo is trying to inspire a similar feeling among their passengers. The all-electric car offers a warm welcome to passengers by name and plays music as they climb inside. A screen positioned in front of the rear seats offers those along for the ride the option of seeing a follow-along map of the route, as well as settings for temperature and music. Another screen beside the steering wheel shows images of what's around the vehicle. As we drive, I can see people sitting inside buses alongside us, dogs crossing the street ahead and children skipping along the sidewalk.
Waymo wants you to see what the vehicle can – it wants you to trust it.
It is part of a wider trend within the autonomous ride-hailing industry. The technology allowing these self-driving vehicles weave their way through busy city traffic is being used out there in a handful of cities around the world. What Waymo and its competitors need to do is to convince passengers to climb inside them.
Yet, research seems to suggest that the public in the US and the UK are reticent about riding in self-driving vehicles, with safety being among the most common concerns. A lot of it comes down to the trust people are willing to place in the technology and the companies that build the vehicles. But also there seems to be a higher bar when it comes to attitudes on the safety of autonomous vehicles compared to conventional cars.
For Waymo, the solution is to instill confidence in the robotic systems driving the vehicle.
""There is something very important about being able to know where the car is going, that the car sees what you're seeing,"" says Megan Neese, Waymo's head of product and customer research, from beside me during our tour of San Francisco. The company plans to keep the seats forward-facing with a steering wheel in its next generation car, she says. It's a familiar set-up in traditional taxis and that ability to see where the car is going helps people trust the car, she says.
Waymo, which is owned by Google's parent company Alphabet, began offering robotaxi services in the US without a safety driver on board in 2020. It now provides 150,000 paid rides a week across San Francisco and Los Angeles in California, and Phoenix in Arizona.
In the grand scheme of ride-sharing, it is still small scale – Uber claims to facilitate around 200 million trips every week worldwide – but the market is growing.
It is also highly competitive. Ensuring passengers are at ease and comfortable is likely to be where much of the battle will be fought.
Amazon-backed Zoox, which plans to enter the market in 2025, is taking a different approach to gaining consumer trust. It aims to let passengers lose themselves in the ride by not seeing what's ahead or what the autonomous driver can see.   Weeks after my Waymo ride-along, Zoox invited me to try their test vehicle at their Foster City headquarters outside of San Francisco on a prescribed course between two office buildings. Needless to say, it was a very different experience than riding Waymo in the wild, across a densely urban environment.  Zoox's offering is a purpose-built vehicle that is bi-directional, with no forward-facing or rear-facing windows. There is also no steering wheel, no pedals and no display screens to show the vehicle's surroundings. Instead, four seats face each other, bay seating-style. On either side there are sliding doors featuring large windows. A small screen next to each passenger allows them to personalise temperature controls and select music while a wireless charging pad sits on a flat divider between the seats. The vegan leather seats are dark green and the ceiling has twinkling lights set into it. It felt like a Disneyland ride.
To help gain consumer trust, Zoox has also begun publicly revealing details of its Fusion Center, where human operators can take control of a vehicle remotely to get it out of a situation where the computer cannot. During testing, the company says its vehicles received remote guidance for 1% of the total driving time.   Waymo previously did not talk publicly about its teleoperations centre, but earlier this year revealed it too has humans on hand to dial in to provide assistance. But rather than using remote drivers, Waymo's Fleet Response team answers questions from the autonomous vehicle about the choices it should make in ambiguous situations.  By comparison, General Motors-owned Cruise lost its permit to operate in California and had to pause operations after one of its vehicles dragged a pedestrian for 20ft (6m) after they were thrown into its path in October 2023. Since the incident, the company has been keen to highlight the layers of human support it uses with its vehicles. These include a team of fleet monitors, remote assistance and on-the-ground personnel to provide in-person assistance. Cruise says that prior to its operational pause last year, its vehicles connected to the remote assistance teams 3% of the time they were driving autonomously in urban environments, but that intervention wasn't necessary on all those occasions. The company says remote assistance provided ""on-road support"" for 0.6% of total autonomous driving time.
Cruise's chief executive and co-founders resigned a few months after the accident, while 900 other employees were laid off. The company has since resumed testing with safety drivers behind the wheel in Phoenix, Arizona and Dallas, Texas. It has also struck a multiyear deal to bring its cars onto the Uber platform.  While self-driving taxis are being tested in many parts of the world, their deployment is most advanced in the US and China. Dozens of cities have approved trials of robotaxis on public roads in the US.
Waymo currently has the largest fleet in the US with more than 700 cars in San Francisco, Los Angeles and Phoenix. It's the only paid robotaxi service in the US and is expected to start offering a service in Austin and Atlanta during 2025, in partnership with Uber.
Zoox eventaully plans to offer rides in San Francisco, after months of testing on roads as a shuttle bus for its employees. Zoox is also testing in Seattle, Austin and Miami.
Cruise has yet to announce when it may open up its service to the public and is currently continuing testing in Phoenix, Houston and Dallas. Other autonomous services in development include Toyota-backed May Mobility, which has city-funded deployments across Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, Michigan, Minnesota and Texas. Meanwhile, Chinese robotaxi giants AutoX and WeRide have permits to operate in California.
China leads the world in terms of the number of autonomous vehicles being tested on the road. The authorities there say they have issued around 16,000 licences for self-driving cars and buses in more than 20 cities. In Beijing, 33 companies have been given the green light to conduct trials within a vast 1,160 sq mile (3,000 sq km) area, according to officials.
China's largest robotaxi operator is AutoX – backed by Chinese technology giant Alibaba – with a fleet of autonomous vehicles in Beijing, Guangzhou, Shenzhen and Shanghai. Baidu's Apollo Go – which operates fully driverless ride-hailing services in the cities of Beijing, Shenzhen, Wuhan and Chongquing – has been trying to win its customers over with low prices, sparking some complaints from local taxi drivers. Earlier this year, one of the company's driverless taxis collided with a pedestrian when they stepped into the road at some traffic lights. Although the person was not injured, it sparked questions about the technology's ability to deal with unexpected situations.
A spokesperson for Apollo Go insisted that safety of all road users was a top priority for the company and that its vehicles have accumulated more than 62 million miles (100 million kilometres) of autonomous driving in real-world situations without major accidents.
Apollo Go has faced other public perception problems, with mishaps involving its vehicles spreading quickly on social media in China. In one incident, a robotaxi caused a traffic jam after stopping for a plastic bag in the road, while on another occasion two autonomous vehicles became stuck in a polite standoff where they both tried to give way to the other.
The software that the cars run on, however, now has a ""plastic bag misdetection"" feature built into it, and Apollo Go says its sixth-generation robotaxis launched this year carry enhanced software and hardware.
Much like Waymo's robotaxis in the US, the Apollo Go vehicles in Wuhan feature a screen that shows a view of what the car's cameras can see or a map-like view with other road users detected by the car's sensors marked on it.
While passengers in only a handful of cities in China and the US are now able to hail robotaxis, testing of autonomous vehicles is taking place in many other parts of the world. Japan is getting ready for its first robotaxi deployment in Tokyo with Tier IV due to launch its service this month. May Mobility, which has been offering rides in a handful of locations around the US, also launched in Nagoya, Japan, in early November, but they still require a safety driver in the front seat. They appear to be targeting older people as the main market for an autonomous ride-hailing service. ""Roughly one-third of Japan's population is aged 65 and older,"" says a spokesperson for May Mobility. ""This has led to more retirees and more people needing transportation assistance, yet many transportation operators face hiring challenges. AVs can help the elderly and others have a reliable and safe option to get around town.""
Pilots of autonomous vehicles have also started in Singapore, South Korea, Australia, New Zealand, France, Germany, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland and the UK.
With the Autonomous Vehicles Act passing in the UK, robotaxis are expected to hit British roads by 2026. Croatian-startup Verne has partnered with Intel's Mobileye on a car with no steering wheel and seating for two, which is expected to rollout to 11 cities across the EU, UK and Middle East, including Manchester, England. One key feature it says it will introduce to its vehicle is a physical switch that customers can use to start and stop the ride. It is an attempt to give passengers a sense of control over the vehicle, the company says.
While it is clear that some people are willing to jump in a self-driving taxi as readily as a normal rideshare, winning over those who still have doubts will be essential for the gambles being taken on autonomous vehicles to pay off.
As the regulatory environment catches up with the technology in many parts of the world, convincing passengers in sufficient numbers to create the scale needed to turn a profit is still a challenge.
GM recently reported a $435m (£342m) loss on Cruise this quarter despite having paused operations for the past year.
Motional – a robotaxi firm partially backed by Hyundai Motor Group – reached 100,000 rides via the Uber and Lyft platforms in Las Vegas before the project was halted in May 2024 with sweeping layoffs. Karl Iagnemma, Motional's chief executive, acknowledged the challenges facing the industry.  
""Large-scale driverless deployment will not happen overnight,"" he says. ""While we're excited by our pace of technical progress, and our initial commercial deployments have yielded valuable insights, large-scale deployment of AVs remains a goal for the future, not the present.""
Waymo is also short of its stated goal of serving one million trips per day with 20,000 cars.
But new actors are still entering the robotaxi market, with Elon Musk's Tesla announcing its long-awaited Cybercab robotaxi. The vehicle will not have a steering wheel or pedals and is not expected to go into production until 2026. Prior to the announcement, however, Musk also announced that he intends to give Tesla owners the opportunity to rent out their own vehicles as autonomous taxis as early as late 2025, with testing already underway in the San Francisco area.
""For Tesla employees in the Bay Area, we already are offering ride-hailing capabilities,"" Musk said. ""With the development app, you can request a ride, and it will take you anywhere in the Bay Area. We do have a safety driver for now."" 
Regulatory approval for such a scheme, however, is far from guaranteed. As of November 2024, Tesla only holds a permit to test autonomous vehicles with a safety driver behind the wheel in California. Musk, who now holds a position within President-Elect Donald Trump's administration, has said he is going to push for updated autonomous vehicle legislation.
Mary Barra, chief executive at GM, recently spoke of her own frustrations with the regulatory approvals system at the TechCrunch Disrupt conference. Federal road safety regulations, for example, require a steering wheel and airbags in cars.
""I personally had been working with policy makers to get legislative change, because you have to change Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard laws,"" Barra said. ""And I've probably been working on it for six, seven years now.""
But the biggest battleground in the robotaxi race may be winning public trust. With many different approaches on offer, it may be some time before the less adventurous paying passengers feel happy enough to sit back and enjoy the ride.

""Flights are operating and we’ll finish our schedule this evening as planned. No cancellations. Some delays.

In May last year, flights were grounded. A similar thing happened in spring 2017, disrupting Bank Holiday plans, and in February 2020.
