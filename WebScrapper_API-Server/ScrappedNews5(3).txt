Twitch streamer Asmongold suspended after Palestinian rant
Popular streamer Zach Hoyt, better known as Asmongold, has been suspended from Twitch after saying in a video Palestinians come from an "inferior culture".Asmongold, who has over five million followers over two Twitch channels, has apologised in a post on X, writing "I'll do better".Twitch said in a statement: "We take enforcement action when there are violations of our community guidelines, including our hateful conduct policy and other rules."Representatives for Asmongold have been contacted for comment.
In clips widely circulated online, Asmongold made comments suggesting he was not sympathetic to Palestinians who had been killed in the Israel-Gaza war.On Monday, the UN condemned the "large number of civilian casualties" caused by Israeli strikes on northern Gaza.More than 42,000 Palestinians have been killed in the war since 7 October 2023, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.Asmongold later posted on X saying "my bad"."Of course no one deserves to have their life destroyed even if they do things or have views I find regressive," he wrote."I don't mind apologising if it's something I think I'm actually wrong about."
Twitch's community guidelines state the streaming platform does not allow behaviour "that promotes or encourages discrimination".It also bars streamers from making content which "expresses inferiority based on a protected characteristic".Asmongold has faced a backlash from his fellow Twitch streamers, with BrookeAB, who has 1.3m followers on the platform, calling his comments "straight up racism".And Hasan Piker, who streams as HasanAbi, spoke to Asmongold on a stream before the ban - but he did not back down from his original comments.In the same conversation, he said he did not support Israel.Asmongold was streaming on his Zachrawrr channel, where he often talks about news stories or trending topics, and has 1.9 million followers.His other channel has 3.5 million followers but is used far less often.However, Twitch community guidelines do not allow suspended users to use their other accounts while they are banned.Asmongold has not commented on the suspension.

UK considering EU-style common charging cable
The UK government is considering whether to require all new electronic devices to use the same type of charging cable.A call for evidence launched in October is asking for views on the benefits of using a particular charging cable - such as USB-C, which is used by many modern devices.It comes after the European Union passed a law on a common charging cable in 2022, which firms must adopt by December.The UK government said at the time it was not considering similar rules.The EU's law aims to cut electronic waste by requiring small to medium electronic device manufacturers to use USB-C chargers.Apple criticised the decision, but ultimately ditched its proprietary lightning charging cables for iPhones in 2023.New iPhone, new charger: Apple bends to EU rules
Electronic goods, from mobile phones to e-readers and headphones, still vary in their charging port and cable requirements.Following the EU's law, many devices now use USB-C charging cables, although some still require other cables such as micro-USB.
Apple introduced its own proprietary lightning connectors with the iPhone 5 in 2012.But after more than a decade of use it was phased out and replaced with USB-C ports in more recent versions of its handsets, starting with the iPhone 15 last September.Consumer groups have frequently pointed to the number of different cables needed and discarded based on the varying options for connectors on devices as a source of e-waste.Materials Focus, a charity encouraging the reuse and recycling of electricals, has been encouraging people to recycle old cables to meet growing demand for their copper contents.Research by its Recycle Your Electricals campaign suggested the UK had more than 600 million unused or discarded cables.However, some have previously warned that the EU's directive will lead to a rise in discarded lightning cables in years to come.

Elon Musk accused of copying designs by I, Robot director
The director of 2004 sci-fi film I, Robot has accused billionaire Elon Musk of copying  his designs for humanoid machines and self-driving vehicles.At a Tesla event on Thursday, Musk unveiled Tesla's futuristic Cybercab, complete with winged doors and no steering wheel or pedals, and a new look at its Optimus robots.But the "We, Robot" showcase, playing on the title of an Isaac Asimov short story collection, also caught the eye of I, Robot director Alex Proyas.The filmmaker, whose film stars Will Smith as a detective sceptical of seemingly obedient androids, accused Musk of copying his work in a post on X."Hey Elon, can I have my designs back please," Proyas said in a post viewed 6.4 million times. 
The Australian film director said he had worked with a "very talented design team" to create the film's visuals in a response to someone querying their own originality in a comment on an Instagram post."Elon Musk on the other hand has a not so talented design team who watched a lot of movies, including I, Robot it seems," he said.Patrick Tatopoulos, the film's production designer, later reposted the image comparing the film's designs and images from Tesla's event side by side in his own post on Instagram."Maybe it is just me, or should I feel honoured that Elon found some inspiration in my I, Robot designs," Mr Tatopoulos wrote."Either way it’s fun to watch," he added.
The claims made by Proyas have been met with scepticism online, however, with some claiming his own film is derivative.Several people replied to his post on X with images of the feminised cyborg in Fritz Lang's German expressionist film, Metropolis, from 1927.But it is not the first time people have queried whether tech companies look to sci-fi cinema and novels for ideas - especially as firms develop new gadgets and robotics to capitalise on interest in generative artificial intelligence (AI).Mr Musk has previously said he was inspired by Douglas Adams' The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, which features humanoid robot Marvin the Paranoid Android.Grok, his AI chatbot "with a little humour" designed for use on X, was later revealed to be modelled on it.And he has also called Tesla's futuristic Cybertruck "an armoured personnel carrier from the future" that "Bladerunner would have driven".Meanwhile OpenAI boss Sam Altman appeared to confirm comparisons drawn between a flirty, new voice unveiled for ChatGPT and a virtual assistant played by Scarlett Johansson in the 2013 film Her in a post on X in May.The firm removed its "Sky" voice following criticism over its similarity to Ms Johansson's - saying it was not intended to be an "imitation".The actress said she was left "angered" and "shocked" at the company's apparent use of a soundalike.

From Wimbledon to VAR, is tech hurting the drama of sport?
"The drama of a player shouting and making a challenge, and the crowd watching the screen and waiting for Hawk-Eye to make a decision, all of that drama is now lost."David Bayliss is describing a scene he saw play out many times as a Wimbledon line judge - and one which the Championships won't witness again.Just as with the many other sports that have embraced technology, the All England Club is waving goodbye to human line judges from next summer, after 147 years, in the name of "maximum accuracy".But does this risk minimising the drama Mr Bayliss fondly remembers being involved in - and which so many of us love watching?
"It is sad that we won’t be going back as line judges," he says. "The game has moved on, but never say never."He served as a line judge and umpire at Wimbledon for 22 years, calling the lines when Roger Federer won his first Grand Slam, in 2003. Being hit by the ball at over 100mph is, he jokes, "quite sore".While he's sad to see line judges go, he says it's hard to argue with the logic."Essentially, we have a human being and technology calling the same line. The electronic line call can overrule the human eye. Therefore, why do we need the line judge to make a call at all?"Of course, even before Wimbledon's announcement this week, technology played a big part at the tournament through Hawk-Eye, the ball-tracking system, and organisers are following the example set by others.It was announced last year that the ATP tour would replace the human line judge with an electronic system from 2025. The US Open and the Australian Open have also scrapped them. The French Open will be the only major tournament left with human line judges. 
As the BBC's tennis correspondent Russell Fuller outlined, players will intermittently complain about electronic line calling, but there has been consensus for a while that the technology is now more accurate and consistent than a human.Mr Bayliss acknowledges there is a "high degree of trust in the electronic line calling".He points out: "The only frustration the player can show is at themselves for not winning the point."
Whether the tech works is one thing - but whether it's worth it is another.Dr Anna Fitzpatrick, who played at Wimbledon between 2007 and 2013, says her "first feeling on hearing the news about the Wimbledon line judges was of sadness"."A human element of sport is one of the things that draws us in," the lecturer in sports performance and analysis at Loughborough University tells the BBC.While she recognises technology can improve the performance of athletes, she hopes we always keep it in check.Of course, tennis is far from alone in its embrace of tech. 
Cricket is another sport where it plays a big role and - according to Dr Tom Webb, an expert in the officiating of sport at Coventry University - it has been driven by broadcasters.He says that as soon as televised coverage showed sporting moments in a way that an umpire couldn't see, it led to calls for change in the game.  "I think we need to be careful," he tells the BBC.In particular, he says, we need to think carefully about what aspect of human decision-making is automated.He argues that in football, goal-line technology has been accepted because, like electronic line calls in tennis, it is a measurement - it's either a goal or it's not.However, many people are frustrated with the video assistant referee (VAR) system, with decisions taking too long and fans in the stadium not being aware of what is happening."The issue with VAR is it's not necessarily relying on how accurate the technology is. It's still reliant on individual judgment and subjectivity, and how you interpret the laws of the game," he adds.
Of course, there is a temptation to think of technology as something new in sport.Anything but, according to Prof Steve Haake of Sheffield Hallam University, who says sport has always evolved with the innovations of the day, with even the Greeks adapting the sprint race in the ancient Olympics."Right back from the very start of sports, it was a spectacle, but we also wanted it to be fair. "That's what these technologies are about. That's the trick that we've got to get right."Technology is still adding to the spectacle of sport - think of the 360-degree swirling photography used to illustrate the dramatic conclusion to the men's 100m final at this summer's Olympics.And while it is true that some traditional jobs, like line judges, may be disappearing, tech is also fuelling the creation of other jobs - particularly when it comes to data.Take the example of sports analysis system Opta, which allows both athletes and fans to have streams of data to measure performance, a process which artificial intelligence (AI) is accelerating.While it might not be the same as a tennis player's emotional outburst at a line judge, its advocates argue it allows a more intense connection of its own kind, as people are able to learn ever more about the sports and players they love.And, of course, the frequent controversies over systems like VAR bring plenty of scope for tech to get the heart pumping."People love sport because of the drama," says Patrick Lucey, chief scientist of Stats Perform, the company behind Opta."Technology is kind of making it stronger."
